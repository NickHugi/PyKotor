"""
Common utility tests ported from xoreos-tools.

This module contains tests for:
- String operations and utilities
- Encoding/decoding functions (UTF-8, CP1252, etc.)
- Stream operations (memory read/write streams)
- Mathematical functions
- Hash functions (MD5)
- Compression (LZMA, deflate)
- File path utilities
- Binary search algorithms
- And more common utilities

All tests maintain 1:1 compatibility with the original xoreos-tools
test suite while being adapted for PyKotor's Python implementation.
