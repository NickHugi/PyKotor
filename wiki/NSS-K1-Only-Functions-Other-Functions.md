## `YavinHackCloseDoor(oidDoor)` - Routine 771

- `771. YavinHackCloseDoor`
- This is an incredibly hacky function to allow the doors to be properly
- closed on Yavin without running into the problems we've had.  It is too
- late in development to fix it correctly, so thus we do this.  Life is
- hard.  You'll get over it

- `oidDoor`: object
