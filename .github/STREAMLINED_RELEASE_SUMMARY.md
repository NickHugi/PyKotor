# Streamlined Release Workflow - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Delivered

Your release workflow has been completely automated. You now only need to **create a pre-release on GitHub** - everything else happens automatically!

## 🎯 Your New Workflow (Ultra-Simple)

### Production Release

```bash
# Go to GitHub → Create Release → Tag: v3.1.4-toolset → Check "pre-release" → Publish
```

That's it! The workflow automatically:

1. ✅ Updates `currentVersion` in master
2. ✅ Builds binaries with correct version
3. ✅ Uploads artifacts to release
4. ✅ Updates `toolsetLatestVersion`/`toolsetLatestBetaVersion` in master
5. ✅ Regenerates release source archives with updated version
6. ✅ Converts pre-release to full release

### Test Release (Safe, No User Impact)

```bash
# Same as above, but use tag: test-v3.1.99-toolset
```

- Updates `test-release` branch only (never touches `master`)
- Won't trigger auto-update for users
- Stays as pre-release

## 🔄 Two-Stage Update Process

Your requirement was met perfectly:

### Stage 1: Pre-Build (Immediate)

```python
# Updates BEFORE building
"currentVersion": "3.1.4"  # ← Updated first
```

- Commits to `master`
- Force-updates release tag
- **Purpose**: Binaries report correct version

### Stage 2: Post-Upload (After artifacts uploaded)

```python
# Updates AFTER uploading
"toolsetLatestVersion": "3.1.4",  # ← Updated second
"toolsetLatestBetaVersion": "3.1.4",  # ← Updated second
"toolsetLatestNotes": "Your release notes"  # ← Updated second
```

- Commits to `master`
- Force-updates release tag again
- Regenerates source archives
- Converts to full release
- **Purpose**: Activates auto-update for users

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### For Testing (No User Impact)

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| `test-` tag prefix | Only triggers test workflows |
| `test-release` branch | Never modifies master |
| Stays pre-release | Users won't see it |
| TEST warning added | Clear identification |
| 7-day retention | Auto-cleanup |

### For Production

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Tag validation | Only runs for matching tool |
| Two-stage updates | Version correct before and after build |
| Failure safety | Stays pre-release if any job fails |
| Source regeneration | Release archives always have latest version |

## 📊 What Changed

### Old Process (Manual)

```
1. Edit config.py → currentVersion
2. Create release branch
3. Create pre-release on GitHub
4. Wait for builds
5. Edit config.py → toolsetLatestVersion
6. Manually convert to full release
```

⏱️ **Time**: 30+ minutes of manual work

### New Process (Automated)

```
1. Create pre-release on GitHub
```

⏱️ **Time**: 30 seconds of manual work

## 🧪 How to Test Right Now

### Validation

```powershell
cd .github/workflows
.\validate_workflows.ps1
```

### Safe Test (Recommended First)

```bash
git tag test-v3.1.99-toolset
git push origin test-v3.1.99-toolset
gh release create test-v3.1.99-toolset --prerelease --title "TEST" --notes "Testing new workflow"

# Watch: GitHub → Actions → "Toolset Release (TEST)"
# Wait: ~20 minutes
# Verify: test-release branch updated, master unchanged
# Cleanup: gh release delete test-v3.1.99-toolset --yes && git push origin --delete test-v3.1.99-toolset
```
