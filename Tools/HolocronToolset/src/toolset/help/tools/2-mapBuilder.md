# Map Builder

The Map Builder is designed to create new areas with unique layouts from existing models. The Map Builder can be opened through the Main Window by going to the "Tools" menu and clicking "Indoor Map Builder".

A simple interface is provided where the play can select a model and insert it into the map. Models can be attached to each other, this is represented with a green line intersecting the connecting models.

Once the layout has been assembled the user can then build the map, this will output a module file directly to the game's module folder ready to be warped into.


## Kits

Kits are collections of models that the user can use to build their own map. Each Kit is taken from a distinct area from the game. Since the toolset does not ship with any kits bundled, the user must download kits first before using the tool. This should be prompted when the window is first opened, kits can be further downloaded from the Map Builder by going to the "File" menu and clicking "Download Kits".
