User:
You are tasked to answer a question:

In Python I am using PyQt. I notice that QThread's do not actually execute concurrently due to the GIL. Normally I utilize concurrent.future ProcessPoolExecutor or multiprocessing.Pool or a bunch of task/result multiprocessing.Queue/JoinableQueue through multiprocessing.Process and an async loop that handles their queues.

However most of this is inefficient when dealing with Qt.

For the purposes of this conversation, let's say I am working in pure C/C++ with qt directly instead of PyQt. Now let's say, for whatever reason, I do not want to use any threading/QThread/QRunnable, and I wanted to offload tasks to children processes similar to processpoolexecutor/multiprocessing.Process/multiprocessing.Pool/multiprocessing.JoinableQueue/multiprocessing.Queue.

How would I do this? What's the most widely adopted strategy to utilizing children processes in C++ with Qt to concurrently handle data...? Is this widely used?

Since I do not understand C/C++, if you must output code, please do so with PyQt/python syntax.

More broadly, find a direct drop-in equivalent to multiprocessing/concurrent.futures for Qt.

Instructions for the output format:

Assistant:
When working with Qt in C++ and seeking to offload tasks to child processes (as you would with Python's `multiprocessing` library), there are several strategies and classes you can use to achieve this goal. It's worth understanding that handling child processes in C++ can be more complex compared to Python, but Qt provides powerful tools to manage such scenarios.

### 1. Using `QProcess`

One of the most straightforward ways to handle child processes in Qt is via the `QProcess` class. This class allows you to start external programs and communicate with them using standard input/output streams.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual example using PyQt to demonstrate how you might use `QProcess` in C++:

```python
from PyQt5.QtCore import QProcess, QObject, pyqtSlot

class ExternalProcessHandler(QObject):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.process = QProcess(self)

    @pyqtSlot()
    def start_process(self, program: str, arguments: list):
        # Connect signals to handle started, finished, error, etc.
        self.process.started.connect(self.on_process_started)
        self.process.finished.connect(self.on_process_finished)
        self.process.errorOccurred.connect(self.on_process_error)
        
        # Start the external process
        self.process.start(program, arguments)

    def on_process_started(self):
        print("Process started")

    def on_process_finished(self, exit_code, exit_status):
        print(f"Process finished with exit code {exit_code} and exit status {exit_status}")

    def on_process_error(self, error):
        print(f"Process error: {error}")

# Usage
handler = ExternalProcessHandler()
handler.start_process("python3", ["-c", "print('Hello from child process')"])
```

### 2. Using IPC mechanisms

For more advanced scenarios, you might want to consider using Inter-Process Communication (IPC). Qt supports various IPC mechanisms such as:

- **Shared Memory**: Use `QSharedMemory` to share data between processes.
- **Local Sockets**: Use `QLocalSocket` and `QLocalServer` for local inter-process communication.

Again, here is a conceptual example demonstrating local sockets in PyQt:

```python
from PyQt5.QtCore import QLocalSocket, QLocalServer, QObject, pyqtSlot, QByteArray

class LocalServerHandler(QObject):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.server = QLocalServer(self)

    @pyqtSlot()
    def start_server(self):
        self.server.newConnection.connect(self.handle_new_connection)
        self.server.listen("test_server")

    def handle_new_connection(self):
        client_connection = self.server.nextPendingConnection()
        client_connection.readyRead.connect(lambda: self.read_from_client(client_connection))

    def read_from_client(self, client_connection):
        data = client_connection.readAll()
        print(f"Received data: {str(data, 'utf-8')}")
        client_connection.write(QByteArray("Hello from server"))

# Usage
server_handler = LocalServerHandler()
server_handler.start_server()

# Client example
local_socket = QLocalSocket()
local_socket.connectToServer("test_server")

def send_data():
    local_socket.write(QByteArray("Hello from client"))

local_socket.connected.connect(send_data)
```

### 3. Custom Process Management

For more control, you could also manage child processes and their communications using lower-level constructs such as pipes and forks in Unix-like environments or the Windows API directly. However, this approach is typically more complex and error-prone.

### Alternatives to Direct C++ Implementation

While `QProcess` and IPC mechanisms can cover a lot of use cases, some developers might prefer integrating other libraries designed for multi-process execution:

1. **Boost.Process**: A cross-platform library that makes managing child processes easier.
2. **Poco::Process**: Part of the Poco C++ Libraries, providing process management functionality.

For example, using `Boost.Process` in concept:

```python
import boost
from boost import process

def start_child_process():
    process = boost.process.spawn(
        "python3", 
        ["-c", "print('Hello from Boost.Process')"]
    )
    process.wait()  # wait for the process to finish

# Usage
start_child_process()
```

### Summary

While Qt provides powerful abstractions to handle child processes with `QProcess` and various IPC mechanisms, alternatives such as Boost.Process could be explored for more complex scenarios. Each method has its trade-offs, and the choice would depend on your specific requirements and complexity tolerance.

Understanding these concepts in Python will help you transition to the corresponding C++ implementations more smoothly.
