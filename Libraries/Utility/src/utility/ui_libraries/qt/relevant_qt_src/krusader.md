# Help Krusader

Here is your opportunity to contribute to the Krusader project. There are things that need to
be done, but cannot be done by us. If you feel you can help, do not hesitate to contact us; every
OpenSource can use some help. Please also check the contribute donate URL page on our website
for more recent information. Thanks!

To get contributor account and commit changes to Krusader by yourselves you should follow
this tutorial. Some useful advices on using KDE Git can be found here. It is a good practice to
use merge requests for the non-trivial patches.

**Documentation**

Help is needed (we are looking for documentation writers) for keeping the Krusader documenta-
tion up to date. The draft explanation of new features is done by the developers on the krusader-
devel mailing list, but we need editors to add this information in the handbook. By playing with
the new features these editors can give valuable information to the developers for making the
new features even better!

**Bug triaging**

Sometimes bugs are not well reported, that can be mended. In order to free developers, so that
they can have more time to e.g. improve Krusader’s source code and add features: bug reports
can be confirmed, or closed. A list of steps to repeat the problem can be made. Some potential
causes can be discarded.

**Code testing**

Before a new Krusader release is made... many testers are needed to report or confirm problems.
If you like to be on the cutting edge of Krusader, and help by the way, consider reporting!

**Adding comments**

If you are reading Krusader’s source code, and you think that adding comments is a good idea,
that’s welcome! It’s very probable that your comments will save time to someone else later,
accelerating Krusader’s development.

**Tutorial writing**

Tutorials are very useful for people who are starting to use a program, like Krusader.

**English texts reviewing**

If you can review English texts, and spot writing mistakes, your comments are welcome!

**Solve doubts about Krusader**

Some Krusader users can write about their doubts, e.g. in mailing lists. Solving their doubts is
very valuable!

**Krusader Extensions**

Please upload your favourite extensions at store.kde.org, so that they become available for the
Krusader community. Maybe they will be shipped by default with Krusader at the next release
:-)).

**Spread the Word Krusader**


If you like Krusader, let people know! Write articles and reviews for internet or print publica-
tions. Encourage your friends to give Krusader a try. Participate in forums to help others in the
community.

**GUI Translations**

Krusader is available in many languages, but sometimes translations do need an update or trans-
lations to new languages are always welcome. If you are interested in translating the Krusader
GUI, please contact the KDE translation team of your language.

**Documentation Translations**

If you are interested in translating this Krusader documentation, please contact the KDE transla-
tion team of your language.

**Donations**

Actually, we had not considered donations, until users asked us for a way to Donate to the project.
Krusader is, and always will be free, in all the terms of the GNU Public License.

**Packagers**

We are always in need of packagers for different distro rpm’s, deb’s, etc. All help is welcome.

**FAQ**

If you have a question that is missing in the FAQ, we would like to hear it.

**Rate Krusader**

On some websites you can rate software, if you like Krusader go to one of these sites and rate
Krusader, thanks.

**Others**

Feedback, Bug reports, patches, etc. are always welcome! An open source project’s greatest
strength is derived from getting user feedback.


# Note from the Editors

As you may notice, this handbook is written by various authors. The draft explanation of new
features is done by the developers on the krusader-devel mailinglist, the editors add this in-
formation in this handbook. We have taken much care in ensuring technical and vocabulary
consistency. The authors write in English even though it is not their native language; therefore,
you may notice strange sentence constructions. Do not hesitate to let us know, if something is
not clear to you.

An open source project’s greatest strength is derived from getting user feedback. That is why we
would love to hear what you have to say. Documentation contributors are always welcome!, since
this is a time consuming task. If you have ideas on how to improve the content, if you would
like to write about an undocumented Krusader feature, or if you have comments or suggestions
about the Krusader Handbook, please let us know. You can contact us even if you find typos!

For information about the Krusader documentation project, please contact the Krusader docu-
mentation coordinator, Yuri Chornoivan yurchor@ukr.net.

This handbook is available in several formats.

- via the Help Menu when using Krusader
- the Online Handbook

The most recent version of this handbook is available when using Krusader from Git.

NOTE
If you are using a development or Git version, it is possible that the latest new features are not yet in
the ‘The Krusader Handbook’. Please read the Changelog file online or in the Krusader sources to find
out more about the new features. For a brief description, please read the NEWS file online or in the
Krusader sources. User feedback and Bug reports are always welcome!

# Introduction

### 1.1 Package description

Krusader is a simple, easy, powerful, twin-panel file manager (commander-style) for Plasma and
other *nix desktops, similar to Midnight Commander or Total Commander©. It provides all the
file management features you could possibly want.

Krusader also includes extensive archive handling, mounted file system support, FTP, advanced
search module, viewer/editor, folder synchronization, file content comparisons, powerful batch
renaming and much, much more. Krusader supports archive formats: ace, arj, bzip2, deb, gzip,
iso, lha, rar, rpm, tar, zip and 7-zip and handles other KIO Slaves such as smb:// or fish://.

Krusader is almost completely customizable and therefore very user-friendly.

Try Krusader.

More Krusader Screenshots can be viewed on our website.

### 1.2 Welcome to Krusader!

Our aim is to give you a simple, intuitive tool that easily handles the most important tasks you
perform on your computer each and every day: manage and process your files the way you want.

Whether you are a Linux®expert or a novice, Krusader makes routine file management tasks
quick and accurate, allowing you to focus on the big picture, not command line syntax. This is
especially helpful if you are new to xxNIX operating systems. To do just that, Krusader uses a
good-looking GUI and supports drag and drop as well as MIME types, making it easy to use.

Krusader has many useful features. It is fast, and handles archives transparently. In addition,
Krusader streamlines many complex file management tasks, reducing fatigue, errors, and dis-
traction. Basically, Krusader provides all the helpful features you have come to expect from other
quality file management tools like Midnight Commander and Total Commander©. Krusader
is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Plasma, the desktop of choice for many program-

mers, network engineers, and other power users of Linux®. With Krusader even novice users
can quickly access the power, convenience, and feature rich capabilities of the Plasma. Krusader
is a free open-source project, and it is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
although the developers still retain the copyright for the project and its name, and manage the
project’s continuing evolution.

The Krusader Project mission is to create an ‘all-in-one’ file manager, which will do all the or-
dinary things you would expect of it, and more. Since the principle behind Krusader is based
on the Orthodox File Manager (OFM), dual-pane filemanagers (Midnight Commander, Norton


```

```
Commander®, etc.), it is certain that Krusader is able to handle all the standard Copy, Move,
Delete, etc. file operations.

From the start, virtual file systems became the main focus. Virtual file systems (VFS) are an
abstracted layer over all kinds of archived information (ZIP files, FTP servers, TAR archives,
NFS filesystems, SAMBA shares, ISO CD/DVD images, RPM catalogs, etc.), which allow the
user to access all the information in these divergent types of file systems transparently - just like
entering an ordinary sub-folder. Files can then be copied or moved around (except ISO, rpm,
tar.gz) between these data sources/containers effortlessly. Krusader currently supports VFSs for
all popular and some specialized types of archives (ace, arj, bzip2, gzip, iso, lha, rar, tar, zip and
7-zip), configuration packages (rpm, deb), and traditional remote file system types (FTP, NFS,
Samba, FISH, SFTP).

Krusader also includes a built-in Mount-Manager MountMan, which enables you to mount or
unmount file systems of all types with a click of a mouse. The user is able to obtain usage and
other property information easily, in a consistent and understandable format in seconds. Ease
and consistency is the goal.

A Bookmark-Manager for local files/remote URLs and an Advanced Search module is also in-
cluded to speed the locating of needed files. Krusader also allows the user to configure Toolbars
in order to provide a wide variety of additional functionality, such as File Comparison (several
user selectable methods available), Multiple File Rename, and standard Terminal windows.

Advanced users benefit greatly from being able to carry out clerical tasks effortlessly, without
distraction from the real task at hand. Convenient shortcut keys enable the user to navigate
folder trees with ease, create multiple tabbed folder views simultaneously, and access fully func-
tional history lists. Due to efficient programming and low system overhead, Krusader is perhaps
the most responsive all around system management tool used to access the full potential of a

computer using Plasma, or any other standards compliant X Window System®window man-
ager. Although designed specifically for - and tightly integrated with - Plasma, Krusader works
equally well with GNOME, MATE, Enlightenment, Window Maker, IceWM, XFCE, etc., as long


as the KDE Frameworks libraries are installed.

New extensibility is provided by the flexible UserActions, a Krusader innovation that allows
unlimited additional custom functionality to be added to suit the specific needs of users. We are
planning to develop more modules in the near future, thereby enhancing Krusader. Information
on what is proposed, approved, or remains to be completed can be found in the Krusader GitLab
page.

No other program we know of, offers so many useful, easily accessible features in such an intu-
itive and simple format. Best of all, we listen, and implement good suggestions that are consonant
with the Krusader Project’s goal: making Krusader the very best File Manager available.

We hope you will enjoy it - we do!

## Chapter 3

# User Interface

### 3.1 OFM User Interface

The OFM file manager concept contains many features that make them powerful enough to be-
long among the best file managers today. The interface is simple: left panel, right panel and a
command line below. Because of interaction between these three items the file managing will
become more efficient.

If you would like to know how Krusader works you can try it yourself, just install it on your
computer. To accept an Orthodox File Manager (OFM) like Krusader, the user needs to get used
tonew ideasthat are actually already 20 years old. If you prefer to waste time and lose a lot of pro-

ductivity, you can always continue to use one panel file managers that are based on Windows®
Explorer.

### 3.2 Krusader Main Window

The User Interface is based on Orthodox File Manager (OFM) paradigm, a 20- year old principle
that has proven its bones. It is known as simple, easy and powerful. In the following sections we
will cover the basic functions of each part with the exception of:

- The Menu Bar which has a chapter of its own.
- The Bookmarks which has a chapter of its own.
- The **Status Bar** shows the properties of the current file (that is being) in focus.

### 3.3 Toolbars

Krusader comes with several Toolbars.

#### 3.3.1 Main Toolbar

The Krusader Main Toolbar is a standard KDE toolbar that can be dragged around the application
(please unlock it first by unchecking the **Lock Toolbar Positions** item in the right-click menu) or
configured via a **Right-Click** menu. You can decide whether or not you want to display it each
time you start Krusader in the Konfigurator Startup page, and you can toggle its use in the current
session in the Settings menu. The Main Toolbar contents can be configured from the **Configure**


Figure 3.1: Krusader Main Window

```
Figure 3.2: Main Toolbar
```

**Toolbars...** in the Settings menu. Since various commands and options in Krusader are context-
dependent, some commands are not always available. The icon of an inappropriate or inactive
action will be deactivated (grayed-out) disabling its use. Bookmarks can be placed into the Main
Toolbar and the Actions Toolbar with the mouse using ‘drag and drop’.

#### 3.3.2 Job Toolbar

By default, the Krusader Job Toolbar (Queue Manager or simply the JobMan) is located at the
right part of the Main Toolbar. This toolbar allows you to view the job progress, to pause and
resume the job list execution and to undo the last executed job.

#### 3.3.3 Actions Toolbar

UserActions and Bookmarks can be ‘plugged’ into the **Actions Toolbar**. To show it, use **Settings**
→ **Show Actions Toolbar**. To add user actions, use **Settings** → **Configure Toolbars...** and select
Actions Toolbar. You can, for example, drag the Actions Toolbar to the right side using the mouse.

#### 3.3.4 Location Toolbar

Below the **Main Toolbar** there is a **Location Toolbar** for each panel. It shows the path the panel is
currently pointing to. When entering archives the path will be displayed in the following format:
‘archive type:/folder/archive_filename/the folder inside the archive’. This format makes the
paths uniform and easy to read. The **Location Toolbar** supports also KIO Slaves but not all of
them, some can only be used with the viewer and some can not be used. The user can enter a
desired path by clicking on it.

- **/mnt/cdrom/**
- **settings:/** will browse and open entries of the System Settings.
- **trash:/** opens trash folder.
- **mtp:/** uses the kio_mtp to access, upload and organize the multimedia stored on Android™-
    based devices.
- And last but not least Remote Connections.

You can copy-paste a URL in the **Location Toolbar** or use a middle click. With the Right-Click
menu you can configure the auto-complete function. An optional **Clear Location Toolbar** button
is also available.

Quick Navigation: **Ctrl** point with mouse in the middle of URL of the **Location Toolbar**. A pop-
up window shows the next URL location. Pressing **Ctrl** + left mouse button shows the location
where the mouse was pointing to. This feature allows faster navigation in a big folder tree.

#### 3.3.5 Panel Toolbar

Each panel has a configurable Panel Toolbar. The complete Panel Toolbar or specific buttons can
be made visible or be hidden.

- **OpenDir Button** : opens the folder browser.
- **Equals Button (=)** : changes the panel folder to the other panel folder.
- **Up Button (..)** : changes the panel folder to the parent folder.
- **Home Button (** ~ **)** : changes the panel folder to the home folder.
- **Root Button (/)** : changes the panel folder to the root folder.
- **Sync-browsing Button** : when active, each folder change in the specific panel is performed in
    the other panel as well.


### 3.4 Panels

The Krusader panels are where most of the action takes place. Currently, there are two types of
panels:

- List Panel: shows the files and folders.
- Sidebar: has several display modes: Preview, Tree, Quickselect, View and Disk Usage for the
    file or folder that has the focus. The Sidebar may be left open or closed, as desired.

Krusader is a ‘twin-panel’ file manager so there are two panels: the ‘Left’ panel and the ‘Right’
panel, or a more important logical distinction, the *Active* panel and the *Inactive* panel. The
active panel is the one that will accept your mouse and keyboard input. If you choose a command
from the **Menu-Bar** or **Toolbar** the command will act upon the selected files/folders in the active
panel. You can switch between panels using the **Tab** key or by clicking on the **Information or
Totals labels** , or by selecting any file in a panel with the mouse. As always, default startup
settings can be modified with the Konfigurator Startup page, and you control the current session
with the Settings menu.

```
Figure 3.3: List Panel
```
#### 3.4.1 List Panel

This is the default panel and the one you will probably use most of the time. This panel shows
the contents of one folder which can be local (part of your mounted file systems, either a native
file or the files inside an archive) or remote files (accessed via FTP, NFS or Samba). There are
two modes: Detailed View that shows the file names, file size, creation date and time and their
attributes. And Brief View that shows only the file names, the number of brief columns can
be changed, by right clicking on the **Name** header. File copy/paste/cut via clipboard between
Konqueror and Krusader **Ctrl** + **C** , **Ctrl** + **V** , **Ctrl** + **X** is supported. **Alt** + **Ctrl** + **R** toggles the **List Panel**
between horizontal and vertical mode.

The following items are available:


- Information Label: shows how much free space is physically available on the file system, the
    file system capacity and where the filesystem is mounted. If the information is not available
    (most often in the case of remote file system) a message will be displayed with the reason for
    unavailability instead of the information.
    The **Media button** on the left of the **Information Label** displays a list of all available media,
    where you can select the desired media (HDD partition, DVD, USB stick, etc.). Pressing **Ctrl** -
    **Return** when the **Media menu** is opened mounts the highlighted media when it is unmounted,
    and unmounts it when it is mounted. The context menu of a medium gives several options
    like **Mount** , **Open in a new tab** , etc. The **Media menu** is configurable.
- Column Headers: here you can change the sort order of the files and folders as desired. The
    default sort order is by **Name**. The sort order can be instantly changed by clicking on one of
    the **Column Headers**. To reverse the sort order, click a second time on the Column Header.
    An arrow will appear on the right of the Column Header text, showing the sort direction (Up
    arrow = A to Z sorting, Down arrow = Z to A sorting). Default UserActions set a keybinding
    for the Column Headers. The default **Column Headers** are: **Name** , **Ext** , **Size** , **Modified** , **rwx**.
    Predefined Atomic extensions like.tar.gzare shown as one part in the **Ext** Column. More op-
    tional Column Headers are available with the right mouse button. The width **Column Headers**
    can be changed with the mouse by single clicking and moving the divider line to the desired
    width (keep the mouse button pressed). Both **List Panels** remember the sort order and column
    width. The **Column Headers** can be changed and saved individually to each panel.
- File List: displays the files and folders in the browsed folder. The search bar allows you to
    search for files by typing their names, or the first few characters of a file name. Pressing **Enter**
    or double clicking on a file will open/execute that file. You can select/unselect files using the
    mouse, with the **Ins** key or the Edit menu.
- Totals Label: selecting or deselecting files will change theTotals Label: selecting or deselecting
    files will change the Totals Labelat the bottom of the panel, which displays how many files
    you have selected (and how much total disk space they use) as well as the total file and disk
    usage of the current folder (as opposed to the information label that displays information for
    the whole file system). If a folder contains a lot of subfolders, it may not be possible to drop
    the URL onto the panel (on which only folders are visible), but the URL can be dropped onto
    the ‘Information Label’ or ‘Totals Label’ instead. When a custom filter is set, it will show the
    setting, example: [*.cpp].

When using the ‘KDE default colors’, then the selected files are shown in blue and the current file
is surrounded by a fine-lined rectangle. By default an icon is shown according to the file type.
Use Konfigurator Panel page to change the default configuration to meet your individual needs.

Some useful **List panel** Key-Bindings:

- **Ctrl** + **R** will refresh the panel.
- Focus a file or folder on the left panel, press **Ctrl** + **Right** and the right panel changes:
    **-** On a file: the right panel gets the same path as the left panel.
    **-** On a folder: right panel opens the folder focused on the left panel.
- For the right panel: press **Ctrl** + **Left** and the left panel will change.

#### 3.4.2 Sidebar

This is ‘Krusader is 3rd Hand’ or the 3rd Panel, click on the arrow-up button on the right of the
**Totals Label** or **Alt** + **Down** to open the **Sidebar**. This panel has several display modes which can
be activated by clicking on the appropriate button.

- Preview Panel: gives a preview of the file that has the focus (currently selected file).


- Tree Panel: is used to quickly browse the local folder tree. This panel behaves like the list panel
    but only one folder may be selected at a time and double clicking or pressing **Enter** on a folder
    will open that folder in the active panel. The panels fully support drag and drop (copy, move,
    link) mouse actions.
- Quick Panel: is used to quickly select files, e.g. enter*.pngand click on the **Go** button. The
    ‘floppy’ button stores the current selection. The ‘select group dialog’ is also available.
- Viewer Panel: views a text file, views an image, etc. A thumbnail view is generated whenever
    you open the **Viewer Panel**.
- Disk Usage Panel: views the Disk Usage of a folder.

It is possible to change the sidebar placement using the rotation button which is located to the
left of the arrow down button at the bottom part of the Krusader tab. Each click on this button
moves the sidebar on one position in the loop ‘bottom-left-top-right’.

If needed you can resize the window e.g. to better display a picture or view a file contents. Click
on the arrow down button to close the **3rd Hand Panel**.

#### 3.4.3 Folder History

Both panels remember recently visited folders. Click on the **Folder history** button (watchsym-
bol) to open the folder history list. Here you can quickly change to previously visited folders. The
currently focused folder is checked. On every new start of Krusader, the history list is populated
by the items from previous run (history is saved).

### 3.5 Command Line / Terminal Emulator

This part of the GUI can have four modes: Command Line, Terminal Emulator, show both and
show none. You can choose your mode of operation either on start-up with the Konfigurator
Startup page, or for the current session with the Settings menu.

#### 3.5.1 Command Line

```
Figure 3.4: Command Line
```
The traditional command line mode offers a single line of input to enter commands, it also fea-
tures three buttons:

- **command history** (down arrow) to quick open previous used commands
- **Useraction expander** (green plus button) to add easy Useraction placeholders
- **run in terminal mode** (console icon) button with the next options:
    **-** Start and Forget
    **-** Display Separated Standard and Error Output
    **-** Display Mixed Standard and Error Output


**-** Start in New Terminal
**-** Send to Embedded Terminal Emulator

When you start typing your commands, the command line auto-completion feature will make its
offers according to what you choose in the System Settings. If you want to change the way auto-
complete behaves in the current Krusader session, **right click** on the command line and change it.
To the left of the input line you can find the local path that the active panel is currently pointing
to. This path is where your command will be executed. Typing **cd <folder>** in the command
line will also cause the active panel to point to this folder. Click here to view the command line
keybindings.

#### 3.5.2 Terminal Emulator

```
Figure 3.5: Terminal Emulator
```
The terminal emulator mode is in fact a small console and acts like one. You can change the active
folder in the terminal by using the **cd** command. The terminal emulator will follow the active
panel folder. You can drag a file from the List Panel and name of file will pasted into Terminal
Emulator. If you drag multiple files, the names will pasted into Terminal Emulator. A full-screen
terminal emulator can be used when configured or **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **F** toggles between normal and
full screen mode. If the command line is hidden, press **Ctrl** + **Arrow down** to focus the terminal
emulator. **Ctrl** + **Arrow up** brings you back down. **Ctrl** + **Enter** and **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **Enter** paste the
filename. You can close the emulator by typing **exit**.

Click here to view the Terminal emulator keybindings.

## 3.6 Function (FN) Keys Bar

### 3.6 Function (FN) Keys Bar

```
Figure 3.6: Function (FN) Keys Bar
```
This bar gets its name from the function (FN) keys it represents. For each button on this bar
there is a corresponding function key that performs the same action. This bar is derived from the
design of the first twin-panel file managers and the FN keys usually act the same way with two
changes: the **F2** key is used to rename files and the **F9** key will open a terminal at the last local
path that the active panel pointed to. **Mkdir F7** (translated name of **mkdir** command) can create
whole folder trees on the fly e.g.foo/bar/test. You can choose to display or not the **FN keys bar**
when starting up Krusader via the Konfigurator Startup page, and you can toggle its use in the
current session with the Settings menu. The actions and Key-Bindings performed by the function
keys are configurable since version 1.51, they will remain active with or without the **FN keys bar**
displayed.


## 3.7 Folder Tabs

### 3.7 Folder Tabs

```
Figure 3.7: Folder Tabs
```
With **Folder Tabs** you can quickly change to multiple folders; each panel has its own **Folder
Tabs**. The **Folder Tabs** positions are saved when closing Krusader. To switch between **Folder
Tabs** , click them with the mouse. Squeezed **Folder Tabs** have tooltips to display the full path.
The following **Folder Tabs** operations are available:

- To open a new tab and keep the current tab opened: **Right-click** on a folder and select **Open**
    **in New Tab** , or click on the rightmost button on the Tab bar.
- To lock a tab, **Right-click** and select **Lock Tab**.
- To pin a tab, **Right-click** and select **Pin Tab**. The pinned tab is a locked tab but with temporar-
    ily changeable address. It resets to pinned address on tab reactivation. To unpin the pinned
    tab right-click on it and choose the **Unpin Tab** item.
- To duplicate a tab: **Right-click** on the folder tab and select **Duplicate Current Tab** , or use
    **Ctrl** + **Alt** + **Shift** + **N**.
- To close a tab (except for the last tab): **Right-click** on the tab and select **Close Current Tab** , or
    use the middle mouse button, or use the Folder tab **red cross** button, or use **Ctrl** + **W**.
- To change tabs: **Ctrl** + **,** or **Ctrl** +**.**.
- To open the current folder in a new tab: use **Ctrl** + **Alt** + **Enter**.
- To close all other tabs, **Right-click** and select **Close Inactive Tabs**.
- To close duplicated tabs, **Right-click** and select **Close Duplicated Tabs**.
- To move tab on the other panel, drag it to the area of the other panel with the left mouse button
    (the mouse cursor will become an arrow pointing left or right) and drop it. You can also press
    **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **O**.

### 3.8 Buttons

Several buttons for fast operations are available: Main Toolbar, Actions Toolbar, Panel Toolbar,
Location Toolbar, Media, Folder history, Bookmarks, Tab, Commandline, Function keys.


## Chapter 4

# Basic Functions

### 4.1 Controls

#### 4.1.1 General

This is a rather short but important section that will go into the details of controlling Krusader.
This section does not try to cover all the various key combinations for two reasons:

1. there are just too many of them
2. most of Krusader actions are configurable in the Konfigurator Panel page

We will only mention the most important keyboard shortcuts with the default configuration,
but keep in mind that most of the Key-Bindings are configurable. If you find that you use a
certain command a lot and want to know the shortcut for this command, or you want to change
this command shortcut, then check out the Configure Shortcuts window ( **Settings** → **Configure
Shortcuts...** ).

#### 4.1.2 Moving Around

By Moving Around we mean the transfer of the keyboard and mouse focus between the different
parts of the Krusader main window. The focus can be in one of five places: the Left or Right
Panel, the Menu Bar, the Command Line or the Terminal Emulator. The panel that has the focus
is called the Active Panel. An Active Panel will remain active until the other panel receives the
focus (i.e.: if the Left Panel was active and you clicked on the Command Line - then the Left Panel
remains the Active Panel). You must deliberately change which panel is active.

The most common way to transfer the focus to a specific panel is to use the mouse to click on that
panel. But you should be aware of the following:

- Clicking on the Toolbar, the FN keys bar or the Status Bar doesnotchange the focus.
- Pushing the **Run in Terminal Mode** button in the Command Line will not transfer the focus,
    so you have to click inside the Input Line.
- When you choose a menu, the Menu Bar will become focused. It remains focused until you
    choose a command - the focus returns to the previous owner.

There are, of course, ways to use the keyboard to change the focus:


- The **Tab** Key will switch panels, if one of the panels has the focus or rotate between all the
    commands in a menu, if the Menu Bar is active.
- The **Ctrl** + **Down** will take you from the Active Panel to the Command Line or Terminal Emu-
    lator, and the **Ctrl** + **Up** will take you back from the Command Line to the Active Panel.
- The **Esc** Key will make the Menu Bar return the focus, if it has it, to the previous Active Panel.
- If you happen to be inside the Terminal Emulator, you can use the **Tab** Key, or the mouse, to
    navigate to an Active Panel.
- Pressing **Alt** + **Underlined Letter** from the Menu Bar will open that menu (unless this key com-
    bination is a ‘Reserved Key’, used by one of Krusader’s actions).

#### 4.1.3 Selecting

```
NOTE
Krusader offers 4 Selection Modes, to say nothing about the Quickselect bar, only Krusader’s Selection
Mode is explained here.
```
Selecting is a skill you need to master in order to get the most out of Krusader. Since the Tree
Panel allows select only one folder at a time, this paragraph mainly explains how to select files
in the List Panel.

Moving the cursor is easy. Left-clicking on a file or folder (referred to herein as ‘elements’ mean-
ing files and folders) will select it. Here are some useful pointers that will make Krusader even
easier to use (assuming you are using Krusader’s Mouse Selection Mode):

- The **Space** and **Ins** keys will toggle the selection of the file under the cursor without affecting
    the selection of other files/folders, the cursor will go one position down.
- **Left Clicking** on a file will select, or unselect, all previously selected files.
- **Ctrl** + **Left Clicking** will toggle the selection of the file under the cursor without affecting the
    selection of other files/folders.
- **Shift** + **Left Clicking** will select all the elements between the previous cursor location and the
    new one.
- **Shift** + **Home** selects everything above the cursor (and deselects everything below the cursor,
    if selected).
- **Shift** + **End** selects everything below the cursor (and unselects everything above the cursor, if
    selected).
- The ‘..’ entry is not selectable.
- The Edit menu can offer more ways to select your files.

#### 4.1.4 Executing Commands

There is not a lot to say here, all you need to do is select some files (if you do not, Krusader will
operate on the file(s) or folder(s) that have the focus), choose a Command from the Menu Bar or
use a Keyboard Shortcut (or the Right Click Menu) and the selected Command executes. See also
Executing Files.


#### 4.1.5 Quick search

This feature will do a quick search for the file name in the Active List Panel.

Type **foo** (one character) to do a quick search in the Active List Panel for a file beginning with
‘foo’. A small quick search dialog box will open below the Active List Panel. Type the first few
characters of the desired file name (more than one character allowed), the cursor will jump to
that filename (if it exists), e.g. type ‘ab’ to search for a file which begins with ‘ab’. The **Up** / **Down**
keys will jump to the next or previous match. **Esc** will close the quick search line. The cursor will
stay on the last file found. The Quicksearch supports regular expressions for searching files.

```
NOTE
If you press Alt + foo , the key binding shortcut will be executed. If there is no configured key binding,
the remaining letter foo will be used for the quick search.
```
Use Configure Shortcuts window ( **Settings** → **Configure Shortcuts...** ).

#### 4.1.6 Quick filter

This feature will do a quick filter for the file list in the Active Panel.

Press **Ctrl** - **I** to open Quickfilter bar. Type **foo** (one character) to filter out from the Active Panel
all the files that do not have ‘foo’ in names. You can use wildcards for the filtering. e.g. use ‘a*b’
to filter files which have ‘a’ and ‘b’ in their names. The Quickfilter follows the case-sensitivity
setting of Quicksearch.

Pressing **Enter** in Quickfilter mode sets focus to panel, when panel or Quickfilter is focused, **Esc**
closes Quickfilter.

To change the default shortcut of Quickfilter use Configure Shortcuts window ( **Settings** →
**Configure Shortcuts...** ).

#### 4.1.7 Quick select

This feature will do a quick select for the file list in the Active Panel.

Press **Ctrl** - **Shift** - **S** to open Quickselect bar. Type **foo** (one character) to filter out from the Active
Panel all the files that do not have ‘foo’ in names. You can use wildcards for the filtering. e.g.
use ‘a*b’ to filter files which have ‘a’ and ‘b’ in their names. The Quickselect follows the case-
sensitivity setting of Quicksearch.

Pressing **Enter** in Quickselect mode sets focus to panel, when panel or Quickselect is focused, **Esc**
closes Quickselect.

To change the default shortcut of Quickselect use Configure Shortcuts window ( **Settings** →
**Configure Shortcuts...** ).

#### 4.1.8 Context Menu

Krusader has many Context menus that allow you to do fast operations with the mouse, usually
a right-click will open the Context menu (depending on your Selection Modes settings). This
list gives an overview of the most important context menus. Use them to discover the available
commands.

- Main Toolbar (orientation, text position, icon size)
- List Panel on a file or folder


- Command Line (undo, paste, text completion...)
- Terminal emulator (send signal, font, history...)
- Folder tabs (new, duplicate, close)
- KruSearcher Search results file list ( **F3** View, **F4** Edit)
- MountMan (unmount, format...)
- Synchronize Folders File List
- UserActions
- Konqueror Right-Click actions are shown in Krusader
- Show/hide Column Headers
- Bookmarks enable/disable permanent bookmarks
- ...

### 4.2 Basic File Management

#### 4.2.1 Executing Files

You can only execute files in the Active List Panel. To execute a file just (double-)click on it or
press **Enter** when it is under the list cursor. Krusader will open it in the default application for
this file type (picture, text file...) or the file will be executed (script, binary...). If you want to use
another application to open the file, click with the right mouse button on the file and go to the
**Open with** sub-menu which will offer more options. Krusader is compatible with the Plasma
default file manager for all file types except archives that are opened inside the Krusader panel
and not in an external application. See the archives page in Konfigurator for details.

#### 4.2.2 Copying and Moving

```
Figure 4.1: Copy dialog
```
To copy or move files/folders just select them and press **F5** to copy or **F6** to move them. Krusader
tries to preserve the time of modification. When copying a folder owner is changed to the user
which copies the folder, group is changed to the default group of the user. When copying a file
owner is changed to the user which copies the file, group is changed to default group of the user,
and permissions are preserved. The owner, the group and the permissions are preserved when


moving file or folder. When copying or moving files/folders a dialog appears and allows you to
choose the operation destination. The default destination is the other-panel browsed folder. If
you enter a partial URL, Krusader will use the current panel folder as the URL base.

#### 4.2.3 Queue manager

The copy, move, pack and unpack operations can be queued. After selecting copy or move, hit **F2**
to use it. After selecting pack or unpack, hit **F2** to use it. Or the direct shortcuts: copy by queue
**Shift** + **F5** , move by queue **Shift** + **F6**. Queue manager performs actions one-by-one. For example,
if you have a pen drive (which is slow), and you want to copy 40 files onto it, it is much better
copying them one-by-one instead of starting to copy 40 files in parallel. That is why enqueuing
is important. If you pack/unpack 40 files in parallel, you overload your computer, but adding
them to a queue, is much more useful.

It is possible to switch the Queue Manager mode by the **Settings** → **Job Queue Mode** menu item.

#### 4.2.4 Deleting - move to Plasma Trash

Deleting files/folders is done by selecting them and pressing **F8** or **Delete**. By default it will be
moved to Plasma Trash. You can open the Plasma Trash with the Trash icon in the Main Toolbar
or with thetrash:/ KIO slave. Physically Plasma Trash is located in~/.local/share/Trash/
orTrashin the subfolder in user home folder which can be determined using the **qtpaths --pa
ths GenericDataLocation** command. **Ctrl** + **Delete** will delete the file permanently. A dialog
will ask for your confirmation and will warn you when deleting non-empty folders. Of course
only operations that are permitted to do by the Operating System will be performed - you will
be notified otherwise. If you do not wish to see the confirmation dialogs, you can disable them
in the Konfigurator advanced page. If you set to delete permanently files in the Konfigurator
general page, **F8** or **Delete** will permanently delete files, while **Ctrl** + **Delete** will move them to
Plasma Trash.

#### 4.2.5 Shred Files

Shred was removed from KDE 4 (and as consequence Krusader-2 for KDE 4). The main reason is
probably that shredding is filesystem dependent and even if you overwrite the file 100 times, it
is not sure, that it will be deleted from the disk finally. Quote from the KGpg posts: ‘The shred
feature has been removed from the KDE library. KGpg will not support this feature anymore.
Moderns file systems use journalisation. So the shred feature should be implemented in the file
system. Not in KGpg.’ But you might use a proper shred UserAction for your filesystem. But
keep in mind that if you want to be 100% sure that it is impossible that someone can read a
deleted file, you need to destroy your harddrive hardware...

#### 4.2.6 Renaming Files, Creating Directories and Link Handling

Rename the file under the cursor with the **F2** key or with two single mouse clicks. If only the
file name needs to be renamed and not the extension, you can configure this in the Konfigurator
General page. **Create a new folder** with the **F7** key. Right-clicking on a regular file will give
you the option **Link Handling** → **New Symlink...**. A dialog will prompt you to enter a symlink
name. That symlink will point to the file/folder you right-clicked on. If the file you right-clicked
on is a symlink, you will also be presented with the **Link Handling** → **Redirect Link** option that
will allow you to change the link target.

#### 4.2.7 Viewing and Editing files

KrViewer has a chapter of its own.


### 4.3 Archive Handling

#### 4.3.1 Browsing Archives

The Virtual file systems (VFS) allows you to browse archives as if it was a folder. Currently
Krusader supports the following archives types: ace, arj, bzip2, deb, gzip, iso, lha, rar, rpm, tar,
xz, zip, and 7-zip and supports the following passworded archives: arj, ace, rar and zip. Pass-
words can be stored in KWallet. Please note that the archive support first needs to be properly
configured in Konfigurator. To open the archive, use **Enter** key, (double-)click or the **Right** key.
Krusader supports also **hidden archives** , these are renamed archives with a *wrong* extension,

e.g. OpenOffice®uses zip archives with the following extensions:.odt,.sxwand.odw. **Enter** will

open the OpenOffice®document and the **Right** key will open the archive. Another example is
J2EE, where the.jarextension means a zip archive. Since Krusader auto-detects the supported
archive types, it will open with **Right** key even if it has another MIME type. Please note that
browsing archives has a few limitations:

- Not all functions are supported by all archive types. (i.e.: you can not delete files in ace or rar
    archives)
- The permissions you have inside the archive are the same as the permissions you have for the
    archive.
- The command line (if visible) will not follow you inside the archive but will point to the archive
    folder.
- Before any action is performed on files/folders inside the archive, they must be extracted. The
    archive will be repacked when you leave it or when Krusader detects that extracted files have
    changed.
- Packing and un-packing are ‘blocking operations’ that display a progress dialog. However,
    this might change in the future since we are planning to create more background operations.

#### 4.3.2 Unpack Files

There are 2 ways to extract files from archives:

If you want to unpack a whole archive(s), browse to the archive location, select the archive(s) and
select **File** → **Unpack** or **Alt** + **Shift** + **U**. Krusader will ask you where to put the extracted files. The
default location is the inactive panel folder. If you do not cancel the operation, Krusader will try
to unpack all the selected files in the inactive panel.

If you only want to extract a part of the archive, then browse the archive and copy the files you
want to extract to their new location just as you would copy ‘normal’ files. Note that unpacking
from a browsed archive takes more time (file by file unpack) compared to unpacking a whole
archive with the first method. The unpack operation can be put in a queue.

#### 4.3.3 Packing Files

If you want to create a new archive, begin by selecting the elements you want to pack in the active
panel and select **File** → **Pack...** or **Alt** + **Shift** + **P**. A dialog will pop-up prompting you to select the
archive name and location. Select the packer from one of the supported file name extensions.

To add files to an existing archive(s), open the archive in one panel and the files to be copied in
the other panel, then simply copy the files into the archive in exactly the same way you copy files
into a ‘normal’ folder. The pack operation can be put in a queue.


#### 4.3.4 Testing Archives

Krusader will not handle corrupted archives since it may result in data loss. If you receive an
error message when opening an archive, or if you suspect that there is something wrong with the
archive, you should test it before use. To test an archive, browse (navigate) to the archive location
and select the archive. Next select **File** → **Test Archive** or **Alt** + **E**. Krusader will test the archive
file and inform you whether the archive passed or failed the file integrity test.


## Chapter 5

# Advanced functions

### 5.1 Virtual file systems (VFS)

A basic OFM feature is VFS, this an abstracted layer over all kinds of archived information (ZIP
files, FTP servers, TAR archives, NFS filesystems, SAMBA shares, ISO CD/DVD images, RPM
catalogs, etc.), which allows the user to access all the information in these divergent types of
filesystems transparently - just like entering an ordinary sub-folder. Krusader supports several
virtual file systems:

- Remote connections VFS: provides the capability of working with a remote connection session
    (FTP, NFS, Samba, FISH, SFTP) like with local filesystems. It is perfect for complex remote
    operations and almost as powerful as most standalone GUI remote clients.
- Archive VFS: allows to browse archives in VFS as it was a folder (ace, arj, bzip2, deb, gzip, iso,
    lha, rar, rpm, tar, zip and 7-zip).
- Search VFS: **Feed to listbox** places the search results in VFS.
- Synchronizer VFS: places the synchronizer results in VFS.

Actions you perform on the files in VFS are performed on the ’real’ files. You do not just delete
files from the VFS - you delete them from your hard drive. Limitations: you cannot create folders
inside a VFS.

It is possible to keep the folder structure when doing a copy from a virtual folder to a non virtual
folder, by selecting the ‘Keep virtual folder structure’ check box of the copy dialog. Imagine the
following virtual folder:

$ file:/home/myhome/mydir1/myfile1

$ file:/home/myhome/mydir1/myfile2

$ file:/home/myhome/mydir2/myfile3

Then do the following steps:

- go to the virtual folder and select the files
- select a destination folder (non virtual!)
- press **F5** -> copy dialog appears


- Check **Keep virtual folder structure**
- Select/home/myhome/ for base URL
- Start copy by pressing OK

The result will be:

$ destinationdir/mydir1/myfile1

$ destinationdir/mydir1/myfile2

$ destinationdir/mydir2/myfile3

### 5.2 Compare

Krusader contains several compare functions: **Compare by Content** , **Compare Folders** and the
Synchronizer compare function.

#### 5.2.1 Compare by Content

Select one file in each panel and use **File** → **Compare by content...**. Krusader will open an exter-
nal graphical difference tool that is configured. Kompare, KDiff3 and xxdiff are supported.

#### 5.2.2 Compare Folders

Compare the files of each panel by using **Edit** → **Compare Folders**. By default newer and single
files will be selected in each panel, this behaviour can be changed in the **Compare Setup** menu.

```
NOTE
The files are not compared by content but by their names and dates only.
```
**Edit** → **Compare Setup**

```
Configures the Compare Folders function.
```
- **Select Newer and Single** (default)
- **Select Single**
- **Select Newer**
- **Select Different and Single**
- **Select Different**


### 5.3 Calculate Occupied Space

There are two ways to calculate the occupied space of files/folders.

- Pressing the configurable shortcut for the **Calculate occupied space** on a folder under the
    cursor instantly calculates the occupied size.
- To calculate how much disk space is occupied by the selected files and folders in the active
    panel select **Edit** → **Calculate Occupied Space**. After a small delay, a dialog box will be dis-
    played with total occupied space and the number of files and folders you selected. The space
    occupied by every selected folder will be shown as if the user just pressed configurable short-
    cut on those folders. If the active panel is browsing an archive, the numbers will apply to the
    unpacked size of the selected files and folders, not their compressed size. After the calculation
    the selection state will be toggled and the cursor will move one step downwards.

Calculating the occupied space on remote file systems is supported.

```
NOTE
Performing this operation on a very large file system (thousands of files) may be time-consuming. You
can cancel the calculation process at any time by clicking the Cancel button.
```
### 5.4 File Splitter

This function splits one (large) file up into multiple smaller files so that they can be placed on
smaller media (e.g. ZIP drives, ...) or sent by email. The multiple files can be combined again to
recreate the original file. Krusader and Total Commander© split/combine functions are compati-
ble. To split a file choose **File** → **Split** or **Ctrl** + **P** : a **Split** dialog will open to confirm the operation.

If the name of the original file isfoo, then the name of the smaller files will befoo.000 foo.001
foo.002etc. There is no theoretical limit in the number of smaller files, but it is recommended to
limit the number to a maximum of 1023 files. Krusader creates afoo.crcfile. This file contains
the name, size and the crc checksum of the original file. It is possible to combine the file without
thefoo.crcfile but in this case Krusader cannot check if the original file was recreated correctly.

An example of afoo.crcfile:

```
filename=foo size=432998467868 crc32=21EB719A
```
To combine the multiple files choose, select a partial filefoo.xxxand choose **File** → **Combine
files...** or **Ctrl** + **B**. The target folder is the inactive panel and can be changed. The file names must
be numbered in ascending order:foo.001, foo.002, foo.003etc. or have letters in ascending
order: ( **split -b** letter method)fileaa, fileab, fileacetc. If the filefoo.crcis found in
the same folder as the partial files, Krusader will use this file to check the combined file for errors.

### 5.5 Checksum Creation and Verification

**File** → **Create Checksum...** : Krusader checks which tools you have and if those tools allow re-
cursive operation (in case you selected folders), you can generate a checksum by choosing a
checksum type from the list ( **md5** , **sha** , etc.). You can then save the checksum to a file, usually
calledchecksum.md5orchecksum.sha1.

**File** → **Verify Checksum...** : Krusader checks if you have a tool that supports the type of check-
sum you need (from your specified checksum file) and displays the files that failed the checksum
(if any).


The system abstracts over different checksum mechanisms and Checksum Utilities. At the mo-
ment, the following checksums are supported: md5, sha1, sha256, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512,
tiger, whirlpool, cfv and crc. Please check your Checksum Utilities settings before using this func-
tion.

### 5.6 Send Files by Email

Select a file and use **Right-Click menu** → **Send by Email**. Selecting this option will open a new
KMail window with the file already attached. Just fill in the subject and recipient(s) and send it.
Of course, KMail must be properly configured.

### 5.7 Profiles

With profiles you can save and restore your favorite settings. Several features support profiles,
you can have e.g. different panel profiles (work, home, remote connections, etc.), search profiles,
synchroniser profiles, etc.

#### 5.7.1 Panel Profiles

A panel profile contains the following: all the tab paths (left or right), the current tab (left or right)
and the active panel (left or right). All this information is stored in the krusaderrc file. You can
have several panel profiles, e.g. file management, FTP management, home, work, etc. The panel
profile can be saved and restored in the **Window** menu. The default startup profile will be used
when starting Krusader, but you can override it with a command-line option.

#### 5.7.2 Color Profiles

Colormaps can be saved and restored with Color Profiles.

#### 5.7.3 Key-binding Profiles

Keymaps can be saved and restored with Key-binding Profiles.

#### 5.7.4 Search Profiles

If you regularly perform the same search operation, you can save the search settings (e.g. include
files, exclude files, etc.) in a Search Profile.

#### 5.7.5 Synchronizer Profiles

If you regularly perform the same synchronize operation, you can save the synchronize settings
in a Synchronizer Profile.

### 5.8 ACL permissions

ACL permissions are fully supported when using properties, preserve attributes and the synchro-
nizer. To view/modify the ACL permissions, select a file and use the Context Menu: **Properties...**
→ **Permissions** → **Advanced permissions**. At Copy/Move, the ACL permissions are also copied.
The synchronizer keeps the ACL permissions as well.

```
Opens a dialog which allows you to configure the Krusader key bindings.
With the Import shortcuts and Export shortcuts buttons you can load and save a Key-
binding profile. This allows Krusader to have the Total Commander©, Midnight Com-
mander, foo-commander, or your custom Key-bindings. The only limitation is that global
Plasma key-bindings and some Krusader key-bindings cannot be changed yet, as well as
some features in foo-commander that we either do not have or need. The Key-bindings are
stored in/usr/share/krusader,foo.keymap.infocontains a description,foo.keymapis an
ini file that holds the Key-bindings. Until Krusader-1.70.1 this was a binary file, Krusader is
backwards compatible for importing this legacy binary format. If a*.keymap.infotext file
exists, Krusader will display it, showing additional information regarding the loaded Key-
bindings file. Here you have a chance to exit without importing the proposed Key-bindings
file.
```

TIP
A Total Commander©Key-bindings file is provided. Please upload your favorite Key-bindings
schemes so that they become available for the Krusader community. Thanks!
```

```

### 6.9 Help Menu

Additionally, Krusader has the common KDE **Help** menu items, for more information read the
sections about the Help Menu of the KDE Fundamentals.


## Chapter 7

# Keyboard Commands

### 7.1 Keyboard Usage

In this chapter you will learn how to use the keyboard effectively, because most operations can
be done more quickly by keyboard than with the mouse. It will take some time to learn the
Key-Bindings, but mastering them saves you a lot of time. Please note that Krusader can use
Key-binding Profiles to swap easily to other Key-binding setups, e.g. of other commanders, or
you can create your own key-bindings.

After starting Krusader, the keyboard action can begin. Use **Ctrl** + **L** to jump to the Location Tool-
bar where you can type the desired folder. After **Ctrl** + **Down** you are in the Terminal emulator
and you can type any command you desire, provided that the terminal is shown. Use **Ctrl** + **Up**
to jump back to the active panel. If you want to jump to a file or folder that starts withf, then
simply press **f** on the keyboard to use the search bar. Use the **Enter** key to execute the file or to
open a folder that has the focus. Be sure to remember the Function Keys - **F3** to View, **F4** to Edit,
**F5** to Copy, **Alt** + **Shift** + **U** to Unpack, etc.

You can also perform several operations with the Folder tabs, including several selection opera-
tions. And at the end you can close Krusader with **F10**.

### 7.2 Key-Bindings

Most of the key-bindings (shortcuts) are configurable in the **Settings** → **Configure Shortcuts...**
menu, if you like to use other key-bindings then the default ones. You can even configure more
actions to a Key-Binding (for the actions that do not have a key-binding set by default). Please
note that some key-bindings are not Krusader key-bindings (e.g. Plasma key-bindings). The
key-bindings that Krusader uses by default are listed below.

**Function (FN) Keys**

These are the Key-Bindings of the FN Keys Bar. These Key-Bindings are configurable since ver-
sion 1.51.

# Krusader Tools

### 9.1 BookMan: Organize your Bookmarks

BookMan is Krusader’s Bookmark tool for bookmarking folders, local and remote URLs, and
later returning to them in a click of a button. The Bookman menu is divided into four sections:

- Your personal bookmarks
- Popular URLs
- Permanent bookmarks
- Manage bookmarks

```
NOTE
You can bookmark inside a remote file system (FTP or SAMBA) and later use the bookmark to quickly
connect to the remote machine, but you cannot bookmark inside an archive.
```
#### 9.1.1 Using Bookmarks

Usually, you click on the **BookMan II** button (the rightmost button to the right of the address bar
at the top of the active panel) when you are in the target folder. For example, to bookmark/us
r/tmp, navigate Krusader there and click the **BookMan II** button and select **Bookmark Current**.
When the **Add Bookmark** dialog box appears, the URL line will say/usr/tmp. **Name** is for the
name you would like to give to the bookmark (e.g.: temporary folder). Hotkeys are supported by
adding&to the bookmark name e.g.&sourceforge, &home, down&loadsetc., so you can quickly
call the bookmark name with **Alt** + **foo**. If you add the bookmark without entering a name, the
bookmarks name will be the same as its target. **URL** is where the bookmark points to. **Create in**
creates bookmark folders for organizing your bookmarks.

To use your bookmarks, click the **BookMan II** button and choose a bookmark. You may also use
the Key-Bindings: **Ctrl** + **B** to bookmark the current item, **Alt** + **right/left arrow** to open right/left
panel bookmarks list and **Ctrl** + **D** to open the bookmarks of the active panel. From the context
menu of the bookmark (right mouse button click) you can open it in a new Folder tab.

There is a quick search bar at the top of the **BookMan II** menu.


```
Figure 9.1: Bookmark menu
```
```
NOTE
The search bar will always be visible in the bookmarks menu if you check the corresponding item on
the Panel Konfigurator’s page.
```
Below are the rules to handle bookmarks:

- Just type letters to search: bookmarks are matched by name prefix
- If multiple bookmarks are matched by the prefix, they are highlighted and the first one is
    selected - hit **Enter** to activate the bookmark
- Once a single bookmark is matched, it is immediately triggered. That is when you type’h’
    and only one bookmark starts with’h’, it is executed immediately - no **Enter** needed
- Accelerators work only if the keystroke is the first one
- **Backspace** is supported
- Search is case insensitive unless you type a capital letter. That is typingHamBurglarwill only
    matchHamBurglarbut nothamburglarorHamburglar.
- Search bar is intentionally a read-only field

#### 9.1.2 Password handling

One of the benefits of the bookmark manager is that the passwords are saved using Plasma’s
services - where e.g. your Konqueror/KMail password are saved. If you have a wallet, Plasma
will save the passwords there. By clicking the bookmarks, a dialog will open and ask for your
username and password. Supply them and click **Save password**. The passwords and usernames
will be saved securely by Plasma’s wallet (make sure it is enabled by your distro). The downside
here is that if the system was reinstalled and you do not backup your passwords from the wallet
as well as Krusader’s bookmark file, something will be lost.


#### 9.1.3 Popular URLs

The submenu **Popular URLs** holds persistent the most popular visited URLs (local or remote).
This submenu displays the top 15 popular URLs, sorted by ranking, so that the top URL is the
most popular. This is easy for when you need to visit URLs often, but do not want to create
Bookmarks, it serves as a temporary bookmark list for the most visited links. Quicksearch in
**Popular URLs** is a fast way to browse/select the popular URLs:

- Open the **Popular URLs** or use **Ctrl** + **Z**
- Type a few letters to narrow the search
- Press **Enter** (you will go to the URL from list)

#### 9.1.4 Permanent bookmarks

These are hardcoded bookmarks to the top bookmark menu; there is no need for them to be
saved to the file. With the Context Menu you can enable/disable these permanent bookmarks.
The following permanent bookmarks are available:

- **Trash bin** uses Plasma’strash:/ protocol.
- **Local Network** uses Plasma’sremote:/ protocol.
- **Virtual Filesystem** Virtual file systems (VFS)virt:/ is not a virtual folder, but a container for
    URLs from different file systems. It is used for e.g. the **Feed to Listbox** feature of the search
    module and the synchronizer. The location toolbar will display e.g.virt:/Search results 1
    orvirt:/Synchronise results 1.
- **Jump back** or **Ctrl** + **J** brings you back to your starting position when you did create a new tab
    in the panel window. This feature is very handy if you go deep into a folder tree, then you can
    return with one action to the starting point. With **Set jump back point here** or **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **J**
    sets the current folder as a jump back point.

#### 9.1.5 Manage bookmarks

To edit and organize your bookmarks, by clicking the **BookMan II** button and selecting the **Man-
age Bookmarks** , KeditBookmarks will be displayed. This is where you can edit/remove and
rearrange the bookmarks. KeditBookmarks is a bookmark editor for Konqueror, Krusader and
other applications, which use the XBEL standard for the bookmark format. The bookmarks are
stored in~/.local/share/krusader/krbookmarks.xml.

```
NOTE
The default folder for the bookmarks filekrusader/krbookmarks.xmlis~/.local/share. You can
determine the needed folder in your system using the qtpaths --paths GenericDataLoca
tion command in terminal.
This local file exists only if you have edited Krusader bookmarks. It will be created after the first run of
KeditBookmarks from Krusader.
The default system bookmarks are stored in thekfileplaces/bookmarks.xmlfile in the folder which
can be determined using the qtpaths --paths GenericDataLocation command.
```
KeditBookmarks is easy to use, however, if you need more information, please read the Kedit-
Bookmarks handbook.


```
Figure 9.2: KeditBookmarks Bookmark Manager
```
#### 9.1.6 Bookmarks as action buttons on the Toolbar

Bookmarks can be placed as buttons on the Main Toolbar or the Actions Toolbar. You can even
make a key-binding for them:

- Create your Bookmarks.
- If you want, create keybindings for the bookmarks in the Configure Shortcuts window
    ( **Settings** → **Configure Shortcuts...** ).
- Add your bookmarks as action buttons on the Main Toolbar or the Actions Toolbar with the
    **Configure Toolbars...** window ( **Settings** → **Configure Toolbars...** ).

### 9.2 Disk Usage

The Disk Usage is based on the code of Filelight. The Disk Usage shows you how your disk space
is being used by a graphical representation of your file system. The following presentations are
possible:

- Line view
- Detailed view
- Filelight view: as a set of concentric segmented-rings

Choose **Tools** → **Disk Usage...** or **Alt** + **Shift** + **S** to start this feature in a separate window, or open
it inside the Sidebar.

Disk Usage Keybindings, right click menu.


- **Del** : Delete
- **Ctrl** + **E** : Exclude
- **Shift** + **Arrow Up** : Up one folder
- **Ctrl** + **N** : new search
- **Ctrl** + **R** : refresh
- **Ctrl** + **I** : include all
- **Shift** + **Arrow Down** : step into
- View menu:
    **- Ctrl** + **L** : Line view
    **- Ctrl** + **D** : Detailed view
    **- Ctrl** + **F** : Filelight view
    **- Shift** + **Arrow Right** : Next view
    **- Shift** + **Arrow Left** : Previous view

### 9.3 KruSearcher: find what you are looking for

Welcome to Krusader’s powerful search module - nicknamed KruSearcher. It is the most able

tool (that we know of) for Linux®, since it allows so many different ways to quickly find the file
you are looking for. The search function is also available on remote file systems. It is divided into
two levels, the general and the advanced. Let’s take a look at the general page.

```
Figure 9.3: General Search
```
The page is divided into four parts: top (search for) part, bottom part - titled **Containing text** ,
left part - titled **Search in** and right part which is called **Do not search in**. Obviously, each part
handles different aspects of the search. Let’s look at them closely.


TOPPART:

- **Search for** : here you enter the main search criteria. You can enter a file name, a wildcard (
    *.o.*,*.cetc.) or both - separated by a space. If you type’text’the results is the same
    as’*text*’. You can exclude files from the search with ’|’ (e.g.’*.cpp *.h | *.moc.cpp’).
    You can use quotation marks for names that contain spaces. Filter ‘Program Files’ searches
    out those files/folders the name of which isProgram Files. A drop-down list that is shown
    after clicking down arrow on the right allows you to pick some of your previously entered
    criteria.

```
NOTE
It is possible to edit the list of suggestions for the Search for field. If you do not like some of its
items just select it and press Shift + Del and that useless suggestion gets deleted. You can also use
the arrow keys in order to see all the history in the Search for field, and delete the entries that are
needless.
```
- **Case sensitive** : unchecking it will allow lower and upper case search (i.e.:*.cinterprets as
    *.cAND*.C).
- **Of type** : this box lets you search for a file not only by its name, but also by its MIME type. For
    example, you can search for all the audio files whose name begins with B. Usually this option
    defaults to ’all files’, but you can choose to search for archives, folders, images, text files, videos
    and audio files.

LEFT ANDRIGHTPART:

- **Search in** and **Do not search in** : Using those two parts, you can specify a search exactly the
    way you want it. For example, you might want to search for a file in the whole file system
    (beginning with/), but do not want to search inside/mnt. All you need to do is write/ in
    the **Search in** box, and write/mntin the **Do not search in** box. If you want to enter more than
    one folder in one of the list boxes, just type the first name and press **Enter**. The folder name
    will be copied to the bigger list box and you will be able to enter another name.

```
NOTE
The input line has an auto-completion feature, corresponding to Plasma global settings. If you wish,
you can click on the folder icon , and browse to the folder you wish to add.
```
```
NOTE
It is possible to define files and folders which will be filtered out from the search results using the
Exclude Folder Names input field at the bottom of the Do not search in box.
Items in the filtering list should be space-separated.
Spaces in the filtering list items can be escaped or quoted. Example: .git  target build 
build\ krusader
```
BOTTOMPART:

- **Text** : entering text here makes Krusader search for it inside the files ( **grep** ). This way you can
    search for all header files (*.h) which include the word’testing 123’.
- **RegExp** switch: toggle the regular expressions mode. A drop-down list that is shown after
    clicking down arrow on the right allows you to enter special symbols of regular expressions.
- **Encoding** : allows you to choose the text encoding.
- **Match whole word only** : allows you to specify that a complete match (letters and length) must
    be found.


- **Case sensitive** : refers to your text being searched for in upper and lower case or the exact
    phrase you entered.
- **Search in sub folders** : perform a recursive search and dive into every folder on the way.
- **Search in archives** : Krusader will search for your files inside every supported archive. This,
    however, takes longer to perform.

```
NOTE
If you check this checkbox, you will notice you cannot grep inside files anymore. This is done,
since looking inside archived files forces Krusader to extract them, which results in an extremely
time-consuming search.
```
- **Follow links** : if checked, Krusader will follow soft-links during the search.
- **Profiles** : if you have to regularly perform the same search operation, you can save the search
    settings e.g. include files, exclude files, etc.... Press the ’profile’ button, and you can add/load-
    /save/remove search profiles.
- **Query to clipboard** : if checked, Krusader will place search text to clipboard when a found file
    is opened.

The above screen shot shows a search for all the files which end withc, cpporhand include the
string’testing 123’. Krusader will search in/root, /opt, /binand/usr, but not in/usr/lib
and/usr/share.

Clicking the **Search** button starts the search and displays the results page. During the search,
you may press the **Stop** button to stop the search. The **Close** button is not operational during
a search, so you must first stop the search and then **Close** the window. When a result is found,
double-clicking on it will take Krusader’s active panel point to the found files - but will not close
the search window, so you will be able to click on a different result.

Sometimes, you need to narrow your search even more. KruSearcher allows a much finer search,
and for that, let’s look at the **Advanced Page** ...

This screen shot shows a search for files whose size is between 10KiB and 150KiB, which were
modified between October 10th and November 1st, which belong to any user in the ’nobody’
group, and are readable and writable by anyone in the ’nobody’ group, but only readable to the
rest of the world.

The advanced page is divided into three parts: size, date and ownership.

**Size**

Allows you to choose the size range of the file you are looking for. By checking the check boxes,
you can search for a file which is bigger than XXX bytes (or KB, MB), smaller than XXX bytes or,
by checking both search for a file which size is bigger than XXX but smaller than YYY.

**Date**

This part offers three different ways of defining a date criteria:

- **Modified between** : allows you to enter two dates. Krusader will search for files with a modi-
    fication date between the first date and the second one, inclusive.

```
NOTE
You can click on the date icon (near the input boxes) to open a standard date window - which allows
you to easily browse through the calendar and search for the desired date. Clicking on a date will
close the window and the date will appear in the input box.
```
- **Not modified after** : choosing this option makes Krusader search for files that were NOT mod-
    ified after a given date, which is the same as searching for files older than that date.


```
Figure 9.4: Advanced Search
```
- **Modified in the last/not modified in the last** : in these input boxes, you do not enter a date
    but a number. This number represents days/weeks/months (as chosen in the near drop box).
    Entering the number 5 in the upper input box, makes Krusader search for files that were mod-
    ified in the last 5 days. Entering the number 2 in the lower input box makes Krusader search
    for files that did NOT change in the last 2 days. The combination of both results in a search for
    files that were changed in the last 5 days, but NOT in the last 2 days.

**Ownership**

- **Belongs to user/group** : by checking each of the corresponding check boxes, you can search for
    files which belong to a certain user and/or group. The drop box lists all the user names and
    group names in the system, just choose one and go ahead.
- **Permissions** : divided into owner, group and all - it allows you to choose certain permissions
    for the file. You can choose to specify permissions for the owner, group, all or any combination.
    The question mark (?) is a wildcard - which means that any permission is valid.

```
NOTE
To clarify, the screen shot above (the ownership part) describes a search for files that belong to any
user in group ’users’, are readable, writable but not executable to any user in the group, are readable
but not writable or executable to the rest of the world and have unknown permissions to its owner.
```
**Results**

Clicking on the **Search** button to start the search and open the Results window. Here you can
see the progress and the results of the search action. If you want you can stop the current search
action with the **Stop** button. In the result list select the file and use **F3** / **F4** to view/edit or use the
right-click menu. When you click on a found item, the folder of the active panel will change if


the selected item is not in the current panel folder. The results window supports dragging items
to other windows and copy to clipboard ( **Ctrl** + **C** ). When you close the KruSearcher window, the
selected item is selected in the active panel.

**Feed to listbox**

When you click the **Feed to listbox** button after the results are displayed, then Krusader ask for
a Query Name, this name will be used in the Results-Tab in the List Panel that holds the search
results. You can do whatever you want on the files in the new tab. The location toolbar will
display e.g.virt:/Search results 1.

```
WARNING
The files in the Results-Tab are actually the original files. if you delete a file - it is removed!
```
### 9.4 KrViewer: Krusader’s internal viewer-editor

Pressing **Enter** on a selected fileopens the file with the associated application. The editor-viewer is
tabbed, configure it on the Konfigurator General page

#### 9.4.1 Viewer

To view a file as fast as possible according to its type, just put it under the cursor and press **F3**.
Krusader’s internal viewer is actually a part of Konqueror, which can basically view every file
type viewable by Konqueror (e.g. display pictures, play music, show the content of an archive).
This is called the ’Generic viewer’, for which you need to configure the MIME types.

The viewer works as follows:

- It tries to view the file with the’Generic viewer’.
- When the file type (MIME type) cannot be determined or when a file (e.g. a binary) does not
    have an associated action, it disables the ’generic viewer’. The file is treated as a text file, which
    is the’Text viewer’.
- The user can change in the KrViewer menu between: ’Generic viewer’ (if available), ’Text
    viewer’ and’Hex viewer’.

You can configure the default viewer mode on the Konfigurator General page.

**Shift** + **F3** views a URL on demand, e.g.:

- **man:/** views the manpages.
- **man:/ krusader** views manpage of Krusader.
- **info:/** views the infopages.
- **https:// krusader.org** views a webpage.
- **ftp:// ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/** views a FTP server.
- **sftp:// sftp.foo/** views a secure FTP server.
- **file:/ home/frank** views Frank’s home folder.
- **tar:/ home/frank/archive.tar.gz/** opens content browser window for thetar.gz
    archive.


KrViewer can have the following menus: File, Edit, View, Settings and Krviewer, depending on
which file type is viewed. They will be discussed in the Editor section. The internal viewer can
follow links on HTML pages. With **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **E** the viewer can start Krusader’s internal editor
(which is basically the same application).

```
NOTE
The embedded viewer is not written by us, it is supplied via KDE Frameworks and KIO Slaves. We
cannot and do not want to change it, using these libraries reduces the amount of written code. So we
do not have to reinvent the wheel ;-)
```
#### 9.4.2 Editor

Krusader’s internal editor has almost everything that you can expect of an editor. Editing is
similar to viewing but with the **F4** key. The default editor is Krusader’s internal editor. You
can change the default editor in the Konfigurator General page, if you prefer to use an external
editor.

```
TIP
When you use Krusader’s internal editor for the first time, it is recommended to look at each section of
the Settings menu, and configure it the way you want it.
```
#### 9.4.3 Menu overview

There are different menus and menu items in simple and advanced mode. The advanced mode
is enabled by checking the option Enable power user mode (KDE 3 mode) on the **Appearance**
page in Krusaders settings.

##### 9.4.3.1 The File Menu

**File** → **Save (Ctrl+S)**

```
This saves the current document. If there has already been a save of the document then this
will overwrite the previously saved file without asking for the user’s consent. If it is the
first save of a new document the save as dialog (described below) will be invoked.
```
**File** → **Save As...**

```
This allows a document to be saved with a new file name.
```
**File** → **Reload (F5)**

```
Reloads the active file from disk. This command is useful if another program or process has
changed the file while you have it open in Krusader.
```
**File** → **Print... (Ctrl+P)**

```
Opens a simple print dialog allowing the user to specify what, where, and how to print.
```
**File** → **Export as HTML**

```
Export your file in HTML format so your document can be viewed as a web page. This
item is only displayed when the plugin Exporter is loaded.
```

##### 9.4.3.2 The Edit Menu

**Edit** → **Undo (Ctrl+Z)**

```
This is used to eliminate or reverse the most recent user action or operation.
```
**Edit** → **Redo (Ctrl+Shift+Z)**

```
This will reverse the most recent change (if any) made using Undo
```
**Edit** → **Cut (Ctrl+X)**

```
This command deletes the current selection and places it on the clipboard. The clipboard is
a feature that works invisibly to provide a way to transfer data between applications.
```
**Edit** → **Copy (Ctrl+C)**

```
This copies the currently selected text to the clipboard so that it may be pasted elsewhere.
The clipboard is a feature that works invisibly to provide a way to transfer data between
applications.
```
**Edit** → **Paste (Ctrl+V)**

```
This will insert the contents of the clipboard at the cursor position. The clipboard is a feature
that works invisibly to provide a way to transfer data between applications.
```
**Edit** → **Copy as HTML**

```
This copies the currently selected text to the clipboard as HTML. This item is only displayed
when the plugin Exporter is loaded.
```
**Edit** → **Select All (Ctrl+A)**

```
This will select the entire document. This could be very useful for copying the entire file to
another application.
```
**Edit** → **Deselect (Ctrl+Shift+A)**

```
Deselects the selected text in the editor if any.
```
**Edit** → **Block Selection Mode (Ctrl+Shift+B)**

```
Toggles Selection Mode. When the Selection Mode is BLOCK , you can make vertical selec-
tions, e.g. select column 5 to 10 in lines 9 to 15. The status bar shows the current state of the
Selection Mode, either BLOCK or LINE.
```
**Edit** → **VI input Mode (Meta+Ctrl+V)**

```
Switch to a vi-like, modal editing mode. This mode supports the most used commands and
motions from vim’s normal and visual mode and has an optional vi mode statusbar. This
status bar shows commands while they are being entered, output from commands and the
current mode.The behavior of this mode can be configured in the Vi Input Mode section of
the Editing page in Krusader’s settings dialog.
```
**Edit** → **Overwrite Mode (Ins)**

```
Toggles the Insert/Overwrite modes. When the mode is INS , you insert characters where
the cursor is. When the mode is OVR , writing characters will replace the current characters
if your cursor is positioned before any character. The status bar shows the current state of
the Overwrite Mode, either INS or OVR.
```
**Edit** → **Find... (Ctrl+F)**

```
This opens the incremental search bar at the bottom of the editor window. On the left side
of the bar is a button with an icon to close the bar, followed by a small text box for entering
the search pattern.
When you start entering characters of your search pattern, the search starts immediately. If
there is a match in the text this is highlighted and the background color of the entry field
```

```
changes to light green. If the search pattern does not match any string in the text, this is
indicated by a light red background color of the entry field and Not found is displayed at
the right side of the bar.
Use the Next or Previous button to jump to the next or previous match in the document.
You can choose whether the search should be case sensitive. Selecting Match Case will limit
finds to entries that match the case (upper or lower) of each of the characters in the search
pattern.
Click on the button with a green arrow icon at the right side of the incremental search bar
to switch to the power search and replace bar.
```
**Edit** → **Find Next (F3)**

```
This repeats the last find operation, if any, without calling the incremental search bar.
```
**Edit** → **Find Previous (Shift+F3)**

```
This repeats the last find operation, if any, without calling the incremental search bar, and
searching backwards instead of forwards through the document.
```
**Edit** → **Replace... (Ctrl+R)**

```
This command opens the power search and replace bar. On the upper left side of the bar is
a button with an icon to close the bar, followed by a small text box for entering the search
pattern.
You can control the search mode by selecting Plain text , Whole words , Escape sequences
or Regular expression from the drop down box.
If Escape sequences or Regular expression are selected, the Add... menuitem at the bot-
tom of the context menu of the text boxes will be enabled and allows you to add escape
sequences or regular expression items to the search or replace pattern from predefined lists.
Use the Next or Previous button to jump to the next or previous match in the document.
Enter the text to replace with in the text box labeled Replace and click the Replace button
to replace only the highlighted text or the Replace All button to replace the search text in
the whole document.
You can modify the search and replace behavior by selecting different options at the bot-
tom of the bar. Selecting Match Case will limit finds to entries that match the case (upper
or lower) of each of the characters in the search pattern. Selection Only will search and
replace within the current selection only. The Find All button highlights all matches in the
document and shows the number of found matches in a small popup.
Click on the button with a green arrow icon at the right side of the power search and replace
bar to switch to the incremental search bar.
```
**Edit** → **Find Selected (Ctrl+H)**

```
Finds next occurrence of selected text.
```
**Edit** → **Find Selected Backwards (Ctrl+Shift+H)**

```
Finds previous occurrence of selected text.
```
**Edit** → **Go to Line... (Ctrl+G)**

```
This opens the goto line bar at the bottom of the window which is used to have the cursor
jump to a particular line (specified by number) in the document. The line number may be
entered directly into the text box or graphically by clicking on the up or down arrow spin
controls at the side of the text box. The little up arrow will increase the line number and the
down arrow decrease it. Close the bar with a click on the button with an icon on the left

```
**Tools** → **Spelling...**

```
This initiates the spellchecking program - a program designed to help the user catch and
correct any spelling errors. Clicking on this entry will start the checker and bring up the
speller dialog box through which the user can control the process. There are four settings
lined up vertically in the center of the dialog with their corresponding labels just to the left.
Starting at the top they are:
```
```
Unknown word:
Here, the spellchecker indicates the word currently under consideration. This hap-
pens when the checker encounters a word not in its dictionary - a file containing a list
of correctly spelled words against which it compares each word in the editor.
Replace with:
If the checker has any similar words in its dictionary the first one will be listed here.
The user can accept the suggestion, type in his or her own correction, or choose a
different suggestion from the next box.
Language:
If you have installed multiple dictionaries, here you can select which dictionary/lan-
guage should be used.
```
```
On the right side of the dialog box are 6 buttons that allow the user to control the spellcheck
process. They are:
```
```
Add to Dictionary
Pressing this button adds the Unknown word to the checker’s dictionary. This means
that in the future the checker will always consider this word to be correctly spelled.
Suggest
The checker may list here a number of possible replacements for the word under
consideration. Clicking on any one of the suggestions will cause that word to be
entered in the Replace with box, above.
```

```
Replace
This button has the checker replace the word under consideration in the document
with the word in the Replace with box.
Replace All
This button causes the checker to replace not only the current Unknown word: but to
automatically make the same substitution for any other occurrences of this Unknown
word in the document.
Ignore
Activating this button will have the checker move on without making any changes.
Ignore All
This button tells the checker to do nothing with the current Unknown word: and to
pass over any other instances of the same word.
```
```
NOTE
This only applies to the current spellcheck run. If the checker is run again later it will stop
on this same word.
```
```
Three more buttons are located horizontally along the bottom of the spellcheck dialog. They
are:
```
```
Help
This invokes the KDE help system with the help page for this dialog.
Finished
This button ends the spellcheck process, and returns to the document.
Cancel
This button cancels the spellcheck process, all modifications are reverted, and you
will return to your document.
```
**Tools** → **Spelling (from cursor)...**

```
This initiates the spellchecking program but it starts where your cursor is instead of at the
beginning of the document.
```
**Tools** → **Spellcheck Selection...**

```
Spellchecks the current selection.
```
**Tools** → **Change Dictionary**

```
Displays a drop down box with all available dictionaries for spellchecking at the bottom
of the editor window. This allows easy switching of the spellcheck dictionary e.g. for
automatic spellcheck of text in different languages.
```
**Tools** → **Clean Indentation**

```
This cleans the indentation for the current selection or for the line the cursor is currently in.
Cleaning the indentation ensures that all your selected text follows the indentation mode
you choose.
```
**Tools** → **Align**

```
Causes a realign of the current line or selected lines using the indentation mode and inden-
tation settings in the document.
```
**Tools** → **Comment (Ctrl+D)**

```

#### 9.4.4 The Editor Component Configuration

This group contains all pages related to the editor component of Krusader. Most of the settings
here are defaults, they can be overridden by defining a filetype, by Document Variables or by
changing them per document during an editing session.

##### 9.4.4.1 Appearance

###### 9.4.4.1.1 General

**Dynamic Word Wrap**

```
If this option is checked, the text lines will be wrapped at the view border on the screen.
```
```
Dynamic word wrap indicators (if applicable)
Choose when the Dynamic word wrap indicators should be displayed, either Off ,
Follow Line Numbers or Always on.
Align dynamically wrapped lines to indentation depth:
Enables the start of dynamically wrapped lines to be aligned vertically to the inden-
tation level of the first line. This can help to make code and markup more readable.
Additionally, this allows you to set a maximum width of the screen, as a percentage,
after which dynamically wrapped lines will no longer be vertically aligned. For ex-
ample, at 50%, lines whose indentation levels are deeper than 50% of the width of the
screen will not have vertical alignment applied to subsequent wrapped lines.
```
**Whitespace Highlighting**

```
Highlight tabulators
The editor will display a » symbol to indicate the presence of a tab in the text.
Highlight trailing spaces
The editor will display dots to indicate the presence of extra whitespace at the end of
lines.
```
**Advanced**

```
Show indentation lines
If this is checked, the editor will display vertical lines to help identifying indent lines.
Highlight range between selected brackets
If this is enabled, the range between the selected matching brackets will be high-
lighted.
```
###### 9.4.4.1.2 Borders

**Borders**

```
Show folding markers (if available)
If this option is checked, the current view will display marks for code folding, if code
folding is available.
Show icon border
If this is checked, you will see an icon border on the left hand side. The icon border
shows bookmark signs for instance.
```

```
Show line numbers
If this is checked, you will see line numbers on the left hand side.
Show scrollbar marks
If this option is checked the current view will show marks on the vertical scrollbar.
These marks will for instance show bookmarks.
```
**Sort Bookmarks Menu**

```
By creation
Each new bookmark will be added to the bottom, independently from where it is
placed in the document.
By position
The bookmarks will be ordered by the line numbers they are placed at.
```
##### 9.4.4.2 Fonts & Colors

This section of the dialog lets you configure all fonts and colors in any color scheme you have, as
well creating new schemes or deleting existing ones. Each scheme has settings for colors, fonts
and normal and highlight text styles.

Krusader will preselect the currently active scheme for you, if you want to work on a different
scheme start by selecting that from the **Schema** combobox. With the **New** and **Delete** button you
can create a new scheme or delete existing ones.

At the bottom of the page you can select the **Default schema for Krusader**.

###### 9.4.4.2.1 Colors

**Text Area Background**

```
Normal text
This is the default background for the editor area, it will be the dominant color on the
editor area.
Selected text
This is the background for selected text. The default is the global selection color, as
set in your Plasma color preferences.
Current line
Set the color for the current line. Setting this a bit different from the Normal text
background helps to keep focus on the current line.
Bookmark
This combobox lets you set overlay colors for various mark types. The color is mixed
into the background color of a marked line, so that a line with more marks or a marked
line that is current has a background that is a mix of more colors. The mark colors are
also used if you enable display of scrollbar marks.
```
**Additional Elements**

```
Left border background
This color is used for the marks, line numbers and folding marker borders in the left
side of the editor view when they are displayed.
Line numbers
This color is used to draw the line numbers on the left side of the view when dis-
played.
Bracket highlight
This color is used to draw the background of matching brackets.
```

```
Word wrap markers
This color is used to draw a pattern to the left of dynamically wrapped lines when
those are aligned vertically, as well as for the static word wrap marker.
Tab and space markers
This color is used to draw white space indicators when enabled.
Spelling mistake line
sets the color of the line that is used to indicate spelling mistakes.
```
###### 9.4.4.2.2 Fonts

Here you can choose the font for the schema. You can choose from any font available on your
system, and set a default size. A sample text displays at the bottom of the dialog, so you can see
the effect of your choices.

###### 9.4.4.2.3 Normal Text Styles

The normal text styles are inherited by the highlight text styles, allowing the editor to present
text in a very consistent way, for example comment text is using the same style in almost all of
the text formats that Krusader can highlight.

The name in the list of styles is using the style configured for the item, providing you with an
immediate preview when configuring a style.

Each style lets you select common attributes as well as foreground and background colors. To
unset a background color, rightclick to use the context menu.

###### 9.4.4.2.4 Highlighting Text Styles

Here you can edit the text styles used by a specific highlight definition. The editor preselects
the highlight used by your current document. To work on a different highlight, select one in the
**Highlight** combobox above the style list.

The name in the list of styles is using the style configured for the item, providing you with an
immediate preview when configuring a style.

Each style lets you select common attributes as well as foreground and background colors. To
unset a background color, rightclick to use the context menu. In addition you can see if a style is
equal to the default style used for the item, and set it to that if not.

You will notice that many highlights contain other highlights represented by groups in the style
list. For example most highlights import the Alert highlight, and many source code formats
imports the Doxygen highlight. Editing colors in those groups only affects the styles when used
in the edited highlight format.

##### 9.4.4.3 Editing

###### 9.4.4.3.1 General

**Static Word Wrap**

```
Word wrap is a feature that causes the editor to automatically start a new line of text and
move (wrap) the cursor to the beginning of that new line. Krusader will automatically start
a new line of text when the current line reaches the length specified by the Wrap Words At:
option.
```

```
Enable static word wrap
Turns static word wrap on or off.
Show static word wrap markers (if applicable)
If this option is checked, a vertical line will be drawn at the word wrap column as
defined in the Settings → Configure Editor... in the Editing tab. Please note that the
word wrap marker is only drawn if you use a fixed pitch font.
Wrap words at:
If the Enable static word wrap option is selected this entry determines the length (in
characters) at which the editor will automatically start a new line.
```
**Misc**

```
Remove trailing spaces while editing
Krusader will automatically eliminate extra spaces at the ends of lines of text.
Auto brackets
When the user types a left bracket ([, (, or {) Krusader automatically enters the right
bracket (}, ), or ]) to the right of the cursor.
Copy/Cut the current line if no selection
If this option is enabled and the text selection is empty, copy and cut action are per-
formed for the line of text at the actual cursor position.
Allow scrolling past the end of the document
This option lets you scroll past the end of the document. This can be used to vertically
centre the bottom of the document, or put it on top of the current view.
```
###### 9.4.4.3.2 Cursor & Selection

**Text Cursor Movement**

```
Smart home and smart end
When selected, pressing the home key will cause the cursor to skip white space and
go to the start of a line’s text.
Wrap cursor
When on, moving the insertion cursor using the Left and Right keys will go on to
previous/next line at beginning/end of the line, similar to most editors.
When off, the insertion cursor cannot be moved left of the line start, but it can be
moved off the line end, which can be very handy for programmers. When this option
is chosen, moving the cursor with the arrow keys off the end of a line (to the right)
causes it to jump down to the beginning of the next line. Likewise when the cursor is
moved past the beginning of a line (to the left) it jumps up to the end of the preceding
line. When this option is not selected, moving the cursor right past the end of a line
merely causes it to continue horizontally in the same line and trying to move it left
past the beginning does nothing.
PageUp/PageDown moves cursor
This option changes the behavior of the cursor when the user presses the PgUp or
PgDn key. If unselected the text cursor will maintain its relative position within the
visible text in Krusader as new text becomes visible as a result of the operation. So if
the cursor is in the middle of the visible text when the operation occurs it will remain
there (except when one reaches the beginning or end.) With this option selected, the
first key press will cause the cursor to move to either the top or bottom of the visible
text as a new page of text is displayed.
Autocenter cursor (lines):
Sets the number of lines to maintain visible above and below the cursor when possi-
ble.
```

**Text Selection Mode**

```
Normal
Selections will be overwritten by typed text and will be lost on cursor movement.
Persistent
Selections will stay even after cursor movement and typing.
```
###### 9.4.4.3.3 Indentation

**Default Indentation mode:**

```
Select the automatic indentation mode you want to use as default. It is strongly recom-
mended to use None or Normal here, and use filetype configurations to set other indenta-
tion modes for text formats like C/C++ code or XML.
```
**Indent using**

```
Tabulators
When this is enabled the editor will insert tabulator characters when you press the
Tab key or use automatic indentation.
Spaces
When this is enabled the editor will insert a calculated number of spaces according to
the position in the text and thetab-widthsetting when you press the Tab key or use
automatic indentation.
Tabulators and Spaces
When this is enabled, the editor will insert spaces as describe above when indenting
or pressing Tab at the beginning of a line, but insert tabulators when the Tab key is
pressed in the middle or end of a line.
Tab width:
This configures the number of spaces that are displayed in place of a tabulator char-
acter.
Indentation width:
The indentation width is the number of spaces which is used to indent a line. If con-
figured to indent using tabulators, a tabulator character is inserted if the indentation
is divisible by the tab width.
```
**Indentation Properties**

```
Keep Extra Spaces
If this option is disabled, changing the indentation level aligns a line to a multiple of
the width specified in Indentation width.
Adjust indentation of code pasted from the clipboard
If this option is selected, pasted code from the clipboard is indented. Triggering the
Undo action removes the indentation.
```
**Indentation Actions**

```
Backspace key in leading blank space unindents
If this option is selected, the Backspace key decreases the indentation level if the
cursor is located in the leading blank space of a line.
Tab key action (if no selection exists)
If you want Tab to align the current line in the current code block like in emacs, make
Tab a shortcut to the action Align.
```

```
Always advance to the next tab position
If this option is selected, the Tab key always inserts white space so that the next
tab position is reached. If the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators on the
General tab in the Editing page is enabled, spaces are inserted; otherwise, a
single tabulator is inserted.
Always increase indentation level
If this option is selected, the Tab key always indents the current line by the
number of character positions specified in Indentation width.
Increase indentation level if in leading blank space
If this option is selected, the Tab key either indents the current line or advances
to the next tab position. If the insertion point is at or before the first non-space
character in the line, or if there is a selection, the current line is indented by the
number of character positions specified in Indentation width. If the insertion
point is located after the first non-space character in the line and there is no
selection, white space is inserted so that the next tab position is reached: if the
option Insert spaces instead of tabulators on the General tab in the Editing
page is enabled, spaces are inserted; otherwise, a single tabulator is inserted.
```
###### 9.4.4.3.4 Auto Completion

**General**

```
Enable auto completion
If enabled, a word completion box automatically pops up during typing showing a
list of text entries to complete the current text under the cursor.
```
**Minimal word length to complete**

```
While typing text, the word completion searches for words in the document starting with
the already typed text. This option configures the minimal amount of characters that are
needed to make the word completion active and pop up a completion box.
```
###### 9.4.4.3.5 Vi Input Mode

**General**

```
Use VI input mode
When selected, the vi input mode will be enabled when opening a new view. You can
still toggle the vi input mode on/off for a particular view in the Edit menu.
Let Vi commands override Kate shortcuts
When selected, Vi commands will override Krusader’s built-in commands. For ex-
ample: Ctrl + R will redo, and override the standard action (showing the search and
replace dialog).
Hide the Vi mode status bar
By default, an extra status bar will be used when the Vi input mode is enabled. This
status bar shows commands while they are being typed and messages/errors pro-
duced by Vi commands.
Checking this option will hide this extra status line.
```
**Key Mapping**

```
Key mapping is used to change the meaning of typed keys. This allows you to move com-
mands to other keys or make special keypresses for doing a series of commands.
Example:
F2 -> I-- Esc
This will prepend I-- to a line when pressing F2.
```

###### 9.4.4.3.6 Spellcheck

These configuration options are described in the documentation for the System Settings module
Spell Checker.

##### 9.4.4.4 Open/Save

###### 9.4.4.4.1 General

**File Format**

```
Encoding:
This defines the standard encoding to use to open/save files, if not changed in the
open/save dialog or by using a command line option.
Encoding Detection
Select an item from the drop down box, either to disable autodetection or use Uni-
versal to enable autodetection for all encodings. But as this may probably only detect
utf-8/utf-16, selecting a region will use custom heuristics for better results. If neither
the encoding chosen as standard above, nor the encoding specified in the open/save
dialog, nor the encoding specified on command line match the content of the file, this
detection will be run.
Fallback Encoding
This defines the fallback encoding to try for opening files if neither the encoding cho-
sen as standard above, nor the encoding specified in the open/ save dialog, nor the
encoding specified on command line match the content of the file. Before this is used,
an attempt will be made to determine the encoding to use by looking for a byte or-
der marker at start of file: if one is found, the right unicode encoding will be chosen;
otherwise encoding detection will run, if both fail fallback encoding will be tried.
End of line:
Choose your preferred end of line mode for your active document. You have the
choice between UNIX®, DOS/Windows®or Macintosh.
Automatic end of line detection
Check this if you want the editor to autodetect the end of line type. The first found
end of line type will be used for the whole file.
Enable byte order marker
The byte order mark is a special sequence at the beginning of unicode encoded doc-
uments. It helps editors to open text documents with the correct unicode encoding.
For more information see Byte Order Mark.
```
**Automatic Cleanups on Load/Save**

```
Remove trailing spaces
The editor will automatically eliminate extra spaces at the ends of lines of text while
loading/saving the file.
```
###### 9.4.4.4.2 Advanced

**Folder Config File**

```
Search depth for config file:
The editor will search the given number of folder levels upwards for Krusader config
file and load the settings line from it. Further information about these hidden folder
config files you find in the document variables section.
```

**Backup on Save**

```
Backing up on save will cause Krusader to copy the disk file to <prefix><filename><suffix>
before saving changes. The suffix defaults to~and prefix is empty by default.
```
```
Local files
Check this if you want backups of local files when saving.
Remote files
Check this if you want backups of remote files when saving.
Prefix
Enter the prefix to prepend to the backup file names.
Suffix
Enter the suffix to add to the backup file names.
Disable swap file syncing
Krusader is able to recover (most of) what was written after last save in case of a crash
or power failure. A swap file (.swp.<filename>) is created after the first editing action
on a document. If the user doesn’t save the changes and Krusader crashes, the swap
file remains on the disk. When opening a file, Krusader checks if there is a swap file
for the document and if it is, it asks the user whether he wants to recover the lost data
or not. The user has the possibility to view the differences between the original file
and the recovered one, too. The swap file is deleted after every save and on normal
exit.
Krusader syncs the swap files on the disk every 15 seconds, but only if they have
changed since the last sync. The user can disable the swap files syncing if he wants,
by checking the Disable swap file syncing box, but this can lead to more data loss.
```
###### 9.4.4.4.3 Modes & Filetypes

This page allows you to override the default configuration for documents of specified MIME
types. When the editor loads a document, it will try if it matches the file masks or MIME types
for one of the defined filetypes, and if so apply the variables defined. If more filetypes match, the
one with the highest priority will be used.

**Filetype:**

```
The filetype with the highest priority is the one displayed in the first drop down box. If
more filetypes were found, they are also listed.
```
```
New
This is used to create a new filetype. After you click on this button, the fields below
get empty and you can fill the properties you want for the new filetype.
Delete
To remove an existing filetype, select it from the drop down box and press the Delete
button.
```
**Properties ofcurrent filetype**

```
The filetype with the highest priority is the one displayed in the first drop down box. If
more filetypes were found, they are also listed.
```
```
Name:
The name of the filetype will be the text of the corresponding menu item. This name
is displayed in the Tools → Filetypes
Section:
The section name is used to organize the file types in menus. This is also used in the
Tools → Filetypes menu.
```

```
Variables:
This string allows you to configure Krusader’s settings for the files selected by this
MIME type using Krusader variables. You can set almost any configuration option,
such as highlight, indent-mode, etc.
Press Edit to see a list of all available variables and their descriptions. Select the check-
box on the left to enable a particular variable and then set the value of the variable
on the right. Some variables provide a drop-down box to select possible values from
while others require you to enter a valid value manually.
For complete information on these variables, see Configuring with Document Vari-
ables.
Highlighting:
If you create a new file type, this drop down box allows you to select a filetype for
highlighting.
Indentation Mode:
The drop down box specifies the indentation mode for new documents.
File extensions:
The wildcards mask allows you to select files by filename. A typical mask uses an
asterisk and the file extension, for example*.txt; *.text. The string is a semicolon-
separated list of masks.
MIME types:
Displays a wizard that helps you easily select MIME types.
Priority:
Sets a priority for this file type. If more than one file type selects the same file, the one
with the highest priority will be used.
```
**Download Highlighting Files...**

```
Click this button to download new or updated syntax highlight descriptions from the Kru-
sader website.
```
##### 9.4.4.5 Extensions

The **Plugins** tab lists all available plugins and you can check those you want to use. Click on the
**Information** button to open the **About** dialog of this plugin.

Once a configurable plugin is checked, the **Configure** button is enabled and you can click it in
order to configure the highlighted plugin.

EDITORCOMPONENTPLUGINS

**AutoBrace**

```
The autobrace plugin supersedes the Krusader internal ‘Auto Brackets’ feature. It automat-
ically inserts a closing brace } at the beginning of the next line after ending a line with an
opening one { and pressing the Enter key.
```
**Data Tools**

```
Enables data tools like thesaurus and spell check (if installed). Data tools are only available
when text is selected, or when the right mouse button is clicked over a word. If no data tools
are offered even when text is selected, you need to install them. If this plugin is enabled
and data tools are installed, additional items appear at the end of the context menu.
```
**Exporter**

```
This command allows you to export the current document with all highlighting information
into a HTML document using File → Export as HTML. Additionally you can use Edit →
Copy as HTML to copy the currently selected text as HTML to the system clipboard.
```

**IconInserter**

```
The icon inserter plugin is only of use for KDE developers: It adds an item Insert KIcon-
Code into the context menu of the editor. If activated, the Plasma’s icon chooser opens
(showing application icons, action icons etc...). If you click on it, the file name without
file extension will be inserted as text. Useful only for setting icons via KDE Frameworks
through the KIcon() class.
```
**Insane (not ZEN) HTML coding (light edition)**

```
A plugin, which does zen-coding like selector completion. For more information see Zen
Coding.
```
**Insert File**

```
This plugin allows you to insert any readable file at the cursor position. If enabled, the
Tools menu has an additional menu item Insert File.
```
### 9.5 Locate GUI Frontend

Krusader has a GUI front end for the **locate** command (findutils). Locate is used for fast file
searching not from a folder but a database. The package contains among other files, **locate**
and **updatedb**. **updatedb** goes through the local file system and stores the file entries in the
database. **cron** often calls **updatedb** every night (set with KCron). Choose **Tools** → **Locate...** or
**Ctrl** + **Shift** + **L** to start this feature. Konfigurator can set additional arguments for **updatedb**.

Checkbox Options

- **Show only the existing files** : if the database contains entries which no longer exist any more
    (deleted, moved since the last **updatedb** ), **locate** does not list them. It checks the existence of
    each file before the listing in the results window (slow).
- **Case Sensitive** : unchecking it allows lower and upper case search.

Action buttons

- **Locate** : executes **locatefoo foo** and places its output into the results window.
- **Stop** : stops the locating process.
- **UpdateDB** : starts **updatedb** for updating the locate database after entering the root password.
- **Close** : closes the locate window.

Results window

- Double-click on an item: steps to its folder, makes the item visible and closes the locate dialog.
- Right click: edits/views/finds the menu.
    **- F3** : views the current item.
    **- F4** : edits the current item.
    **- Ctrl** + **F** : finds files in the results window.
    **- Ctrl** + **N** : shows the next search result.
    **- Ctrl** + **P** : shows the previous search result.
- The results window supports dragging items to other windows and copy to clipboard
    ( **Ctrl** + **C** ).


### 9.6 MountMan: work with your mounted file systems

MountMan is a tool which helps you manage your mounted file systems. Once invoked, it dis-
plays a list of every mounted file system. For each file system, MountMan displays its name
(which is the actual device name - i.e./dev/sda1for a first partition on first HDD), its type (ext4,
ext3, ntfs, vfat, ReiserFS...) and its mount point on your system (the folder on which the file
system is mounted).

If you want filter out non-removable devices from the list, just check the item **Show only remov-
able devices** at the left of the device list.

```
Figure 9.5: MountMan
```
MountMan also displays usage information using total size, free size, and percentage of available
space free. If those numbers say **N/A** , that usually means that the file system is not mounted. Left
clicking on a file system displays a pie chart on the left of the window, graphically displaying the
usage information for the file system. Clicking on a non-mounted file system will display **not
mounted** instead of the graph.

- **Double-clicking** on a file system will close MountMan and open that file system inside Kru-
    sader’s active panel.
- **Right-clicking** on a file system will open a small menu which displays what actions can be
    performed on that file system. At the moment, you can only mount, unmount and eject (if
    clicking on a removable file system, e.g., a CD-ROM).

```
NOTE
We plan to expand MountMan in the next evolution of Krusader. It will be able to format partitions,
edit/etc/fstab, create new file systems and more.... By the way, we have started working on it, see
‘Quickmode for MountMan’.
```

**Quickmode for MountMan**

To activate Quickmode for MountMan, click lateral button with arrow on the MountMan button
on the Main Toolbar.

General idea: display a list of all possible mount points. Each time the menu is displayed, it de-
termines if a mount point is mounted or not and associates the correct action (mount or umount).
This offers a quick interface to MountMan. It is working, and currently uses KMountMan::mount
and unmount. It uses the new KDE Frameworks 5 services for fstab-reading and this will enable
us to remove a lot of code from the ‘old’ MountMan.

### 9.7 Remote Connections

Remote connections are easily made by typing the URL in the Location Toolbar; these are actually
KIO Slaves. Please note that the Krusader panel does not support all KIO Slave e.g. **[http://](http://)** will
not work in the panel, but will work in the viewer. Some examples:

- **ftp:// public.ftpserver.org/folder/**
- **fish:// username@hostname/**
- **sftp:// username:password@sftp.foo.org/**
- **ftp:// username@my.server.org:21/folder/**
- **smb:// username:password@server/share**
- **ftp:// username@proxyusername:password@proxipassword@hostname/folde**
    **r**
- **nfs:// <host>:<port><url-path>**
- **webdav:// [http://www.server.com/path/](http://www.server.com/path/)**

You can bookmark these URLs, however, please read the Bookman section regardingsecurely
save passwords. For connecting to multiple locations, bookmark these URLs and open them one
by one, or open them all together by using Panel profiles. To switch from one to another location,
just open a Folder tabs for each.

There are three ways to start a remote connection:

- Type the URL in the Location Toolbar
- Select **Tools** → **New Net Connection** which will pop-up a dialog that will ask for the remote
    site details. This dialog is handy if you are not used to type remote URLs in the Location
    Toolbar. Leaving the password and user name fields empty will log you in as anonymous.
    Note: we are planning to rewrite this dialog window.
- You can bookmark a folder on a remote host and return to this folder from the bookmark
    button on the top corner of your panel just like in a web browser.

After you log on to a remote server you can browse it just like your local hard drive with the
following exceptions:

- You cannot execute files on remote servers.
- Permissions cannot always be calculated on remote servers (depends on server and access
    method) so you might get a**?** on the permissions columns for some files.
- Disk usage information is not available for most remote filesystems.

To change the charset of the remote host use **View** → **Select Remote Charset**.

You can close the current Active Remote Connection by two separate methods:


- Manually: Add the disconnect button to the Main Toolbar and click on it.
- Automatically: Change the URL in the Location Toolbar.

```
NOTE
Krusader is a file manager that supports remote connections via KIO Slaves, but if you are looking for
even more advanced remote connections features, e.g. an advanced FTP client we recommend you
to use e.g. LFTP or FileZilla.
```
#### 9.7.1 LAN connections via fish:/ protocol (zeroconf)

This section is contributed by Andrew Svet (z-vet), feedback about this chapter is appreciated.
Thanks!

```
NOTE
This works on a Debian system, so it will work on Debian and derivatives (Kubuntu™, etc.), though
it should work on other Linuxes as well. We assume that you have SSH installed, configured and
working on every machine on LAN you want to connect to/from. There are plenty of very good tutorials
about SSH on the net, e.g. at linuxhomenetworking.com or just google for it. We use the default SSH
port (22) for this chapter. Remember to change it if you use different one. All modifications, editing etc.
must be done as root.
```
Let’s start with installing all the packages we need:

# apt-get install avahi-daemon libnss -mdns kdnssd

Everything is installed, now let’s do some configuration. First, we need our services to be an-
nounced on LAN. That is why we installed avahi-daemon: it represents your machine on local
network and allows other applications to publish services they provide. Avahi-daemon comes
with examplessh.serviceconfiguration file found in/usr/share/doc/avahi-daemon/examples.
In order to get the service to be announced on LAN we need to copy this file to/etc/avahi/ser
vicesfolder:

# cp /usr/share/doc/avahi-daemon/examples/ssh.service /etc/avahi/services

Now we need fish:/ protocol to be announced too, so we use an ssh.service file as a template for
fish.service:

# cp /etc/avahi/services/ssh.service /etc/avahi/services/fish.service

This file is just a copy of ssh.service. Edit thefish.servicefile and replace ‘Remote Terminal on
%h’ with ‘Fish to %h’ and ‘_ssh._tcp’ with ‘_fish._tcp’. Here is how it looks after edit:

```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone=’no’?><!--*-nxml-*-->
<!DOCTYPE service -group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
```
```
<!-- $Id: remote -connections.docbook ,v 1.6 2007/05/02 18:07:28 codeknight ←↩

```
<service -group>
```
```
<name replace -wildcards="yes">FISH to %h</name>
```
```
<service >
<type>_fish._tcp </type>
<port >22</port>
</service >
```
```
</service -group>
```
Save the modified file. Now we need to create a new file_fish._tcp, open a text editor and add
the next lines:

```
Name=FISH Protocol (ssh)
Type=_fish._tcp
UserEntry=u
PathEntry=path
PasswordEntry=p
```
And save the file/usr/share/apps/zeroconf/_fish._tcpDo the same on each machine on your
LAN, then restart avahi-daemon:

# /etc/init.d/ avahi-daemon restart

Then open Krusader and type in location-toolbar-lnk: zeroconf:/ to open the zeroconf con-
nection. Enter the **Fish Protocol** folder. Inside you will find the links to each machine that an-
nouncedfish:/ on your LAN, the location-toolbar-lnk: will point tozeroconf:/_fish._tcp
Double clicking on any of these machines, them will bring up the password prompt, asking you
for your ssh key passphrase (if password was set). Enter your passphrase. Congratulations: you
connected to remote machine using Krusader!

### 9.8 Synchronizer

#### 9.8.1 Introduction

This function compares two folders with all subfolders and shows the differences between them.
After selecting some options and the **Compare** function you can synchronize the files and folders.
One panel could be an FTP server. Do not forget the **Compare by content** option if the file size
stays equal. Choose **Tools** → **Synchronize Folders** or **Ctrl** + **Y** to start this feature. The colors are
configurable. The synchronizer has its own keybindings.

```
NOTE
For local files: The synchronizer changes the date information to the original dates.
```

```
Figure 9.6: Synchronizer
```
PROCEDURE:

1. Set the **Left folder** and the **Right folder** that you want to compare.
2. Configure the optional **File Filter** , **General Filters** and **Advanced filters**. The **General Fil-**
    **ters** includes a **Do not search in** option which lets you exclude folders from comparison.
3. Set the Checkbox options: **Recurse subfolders** , **Follow symlinks** , **Compare by content** ,
    **Ignore Date** , **Asymmetric** and **Ignore Case**.
4. Click on the **Compare** button to compare the folders.
5. By using Show options, you can include/exclude particular file types. The files that are not
    on the list will be untouched by synchronization.
6. If needed, you can change the **Task** operations determined by the Comparator with the
    right click menu.
7. When you agree with the **Compare** results, click on the **Synchronize** button to show the
    synchronize dialog.
8. After selecting the options of the Synchronizer, click on the **Start** button to start the syn-
    chronization process.

A detailed explanation of all the functions and buttons is described in the following text.

#### 9.8.2 Comparator

**Panel elements**


- **Left Directory** : The left side base folder.
- **Right Directory** : The right side base folder.
- **File Filter** : Filters the filenames at synchronizing. e.g.*.pngselects only files the names
    of which end with.png. Folders are listed if the folder name ends with.pngor if the
    folder contains files which end with.png. Multiple include/exclude example:’*.cpp
    *.h | *.moc.cpp’includes*.cpp *.hand exclude*.moc.cpp.
- **General filters** : Search for, containing text
- **Advanced filters** : Size, date, ownership

**Filename filtering criteria**

- You can make use of wild cards. Multiple patterns are separated by space (means logical
    OR) and patterns are excluded from the search using the pipe symbol. If the pattern
    is ended with a slash (*pattern*/), it means that pattern relates to recursive search of
    folders.
- pattern - means to search those files/folders whose name is a pattern, recursive search
    goes through all subfolders independently of the value of the pattern.
- pattern/ - means to search all files/folders, but recursive search goes through/excludes
    the folders whose name is a pattern.
- You can use quotation marks for names that contain spaces. Filter ‘Program Files’
    searches out those files/folders the name of which isProgram Files.
- Examples:
- *.o
- *.h *.c??
- *.cpp *.h | *.moc.cpp
- * | CVS/ .svn/
- Note: the search term ’text’ is equivalent to ’*text*’.

**Checkbox options**

- **Recurse subfolders** : The Synchronizer walks through subfolders when comparing.
- **Follow symlinks** : The Synchronizer follows the symbolic links to folders (not the files!).
- **Compare by content** : The files the sizes of which are equal will be compared by content
    as well.
- **Ignore Date** : Ignores the date information (useful for FTP, smb, archive, ... ) the date
    information is relevant *only* in the local file system.
- **Asymmetric** : The **Left Directory** is the target folder, the **Right Directory** is the source
    folder. This function synchronizes the content of the left folder to the right folder.
    **-** The files that exist only on the left side will be deleted.
    **-** The files that exist only on the right side will be copied to left.
    **-** The files considered to be equal will be untouched.
    **-** Those files considered to be different will be copied to left. Use this feature with care!
    This function is useful if the date information is unusable, or to synchronize the left
    folder to the content of a file server (like a download). Alternatively, it is useful to make
    a backup from the right folder to the left folder. NOTE: Do NOT use this option to
    synchronize a desktop and a notebook (e.g. files that exist only on the left side will be
    deleted!).
- **Scroll Results** : This is for slow FTP servers, ... When the Synchronizer has finished
    comparing a file, it puts the file into the end of the list at once and scrolls the window,
    if necessary. It is important, if you want to know what the Synchronizer is doing. If the
    FTP server is slow, the comparison of a folder may take a lot of time. By turning this
    option on, you can see that the comparator is ‘alive’, but slow. For fast file systems, it can
    reduce the speed of comparing slightly.


- **Ignore Case** : Case insensitive filename compare, this is useful when synchronizing
    Windows®filesystems.
- **Ignore hidden files** : Ignores files that start with a dot.

When everything mentioned above is done, click on the **Compare** button to compare the folders,
the results are displayed in the **File List**.

**File List**

```
The File List has the following columns: ‘Left name | Left size | Left time | Task | Right
time | Right size | Right name’. Here you can check the compare results and modify
the synchronization actions if desired. The text color defines the default copy direction
determined by the comparator.
```
- Green: Copy from left to right.
- Blue: Copy from right to left or delete on the right side in asymmetric mode.
- Red: Files which are different by the given criteria (no copy direction).
- Black: Files which are identical (no copy direction).

```
A double click on a file calls the Krusaders Compare by content function. The Tasks (<=>)
column defines the default copy direction, which can be modified by the user if needed.
The results window supports dragging items to other windows ( drag [left], Shift +drag
[right] ) and copy left/right selected items to clipboard ( Ctrl + C ).
```
**File List: Tasks (<=>) column**

```
This column displays the task that is planned for the Synchronizer, this task can be modified
with the right click menu.
```
- **->** : Copy from the left side to the right side. For folders: **mkdir** in the right side.
- **=** : The files are the same, do not do anything.
- **!=** : The file is excluded, or the Synchronizer does not know what to do.
- **<-** : copy from the right side to the left side. For folders: **mkdir** in the left side
- **DEL** : delete files from the right side.

**Show options**

```
Here you can include/exclude particular file types. Those files, that are not in the list, will
be untouched at synchronization.
```
- **->** : Enable/Disable the copy task from left to right.
- **=** : Enable/Disable listing the equal files.
- **!=** : Enable/Disable listing the excluded / ‘do not know what to do’ files.
- **<-** : Enable/Disable the copy task from right to left.
- **Trash** : Enable/Disable the file deleting from the left side task.
- **Duplicates** : Enable/Disable those files that exist on both sides.
- **Singles** : Enable/Disable those files that exist only on one side.

**Action buttons**

- **Compare** : Compares the folders, the results are displayed on the **File List**.
- **Stop** : Stops comparing.
- **Synchronize** : Shows the synchronize dialog.
- **Close** : Closes the Synchronizer window.


**The Status line may contain**

- The number of scanned folders while comparing.
- The filename when comparing by content (for big files).
- The number of files on the list.

**Right click menu on the File List**

```
The right click menu is split up in three sections:
```
1. change the **Task** operations determined by the Comparator. Select one or multiple files.
The change will be applied on the selection and not only on the right clicked item. If the
selected item is a folder, the change will be applied on its files/subfolders as well.
- **Synchronize Folders...** : Starts synchronization.
- **Exclude** : Excludes a file/dir from synchronization ( task change to != ).
- **Restore original operation** : Task change to the original result of comparison.
- **Reverse direction** : Task change ( -> to <-, and <- to -> ).
- **Copy from right to left** : Task change to <-.
- **Copy from left to right** : Task change to ->.
- **Delete ( left single )** : Task change to DEL.
2. change the selections
- **Select items** : Opens a dialog which allows you to select items. This is the **Select Group**
    dialog from the Edit menu.
- **Unselect items** : Opens a dialog which allows you to deselect items. This is the **Unselect**
    **Group** dialog from the Edit menu.
- **Invert selection** : Invert the selection status of all items.
3. others (note that the following operations work on the right-clicked file and not on the
selection).
- **View left file** : Starts viewer on the left file.
- **View right file** : Starts viewer on the right file.
- **Compare Files** : Starts the diff utility (e.g. Kompare) on the files.

**Other buttons**

- **Profiles** : If you have to synchronize the same folders often, you can save the settings e.g.
    include files, exclude files, ... Press the **Profile** button, and you will be able to add / load
    / save / remove synchronizer profiles.
- **Swap sides** : Swaps the **File List**.

**Synchronize with kget**

```
If you want to synchronize a local folder with an unstable FTP server, kget is a much better
solution than simple file copying. After comparing you may right click on the result list
and select Synchronize with KGet to execute the synchronization, after that the listed files
will be downloaded with kget instead of Krusader. Of course kget needs to be installed on
your computer; otherwise, it will not be available.
```

#### 9.8.3 Synchronization

After pressing the **Synchronize** button the synchronization dialog appears.

**Check boxes**

```
Here you confirm the copy and delete operations of the Synchronizer
```
- **Right to left** : copy X1 files ( Y1 bytes ) enable / disable the copy from right to left.
- **Left to right** : copy X2 files ( Y2 bytes ) enable / disable the copy from left to right.
- **Left** : delete X3 files ( Y3 bytes ) enable / disable the left side deleting.
- **Confirm overwrites** : By switching this option on, Krusader will show the **rename, skip,**
    **overwrite, skip all, overwrite all** dialog box, before overwriting the file.

**Status labels**

- **Ready** : A1/A2 files, B1/B2. This line is changed at synchronizing, showing that syn-
    chronizer finished with A1 files from A2 ( B1 bytes from B2 ).
- **Progress bar** : Shows the progress on the synchronization (based on bytes).

**Action buttons**

- **Start** : Starts synchronization.
- **Pause / Resume** : Pauses/resumes the synchronization process.
- **Close** : Closes the synchronization dialog (and stops synchronization).

**Parallel synchronization**

- One can give the number of the ’quasi’ threads.
- Can drastically increase the speed when synchronized with slow FTP servers.
- Does not affect the speed of local synchronization.
- Remote ‘compare by content’ and ‘folder compare’ is done in parallel.
- Remote synchronization is also done in parallel, except the **mkdir** tasks ( **mkdir** must be
    before copy).

### 9.9 UserActions

With ActionMan you can set up, configure and manage UserActions. Some general settings are
configured with Konfigurator. With UserActions you can perform actions on files in the panel or
to access Krusader internal functions with parameters directly using placeholders. The actions
integrate seamlessly into Plasma action system, which means that the standard Edit Toolbar and
Edit Shortcut dialogs will show UserActions, too. The UserActions are stored in~/.local/sh
are/krusader/useractions.xmlorkrusader/useraction.xmlin the folder which can be deter-
mined using the **qtpaths --paths GenericDataLocation** command. Several examples
are included in the documentation. UserActions can be edited / added / imported / exported
by using ActionMan. The default UserActions are stored in/usr/share/krusader/useractio
n-examples.xml. UserActions can appear nearly everywhere where ‘normal’ KActions can be
placed. The actions can even be placed in the menu bar, but for that thekrusaderui.rcfile must
be edited. A few examples:

- Useractions Menu
- User Menu
- Actions Toolbar


- right click menus
- etc.

Krusader’s UserActions tool is very powerful and customizable if you are familiar with writing
UserActions in general.

```
TIP
Several UserActions are provided by default. Please upload your favorite UserActions so that they
become available for the Krusader community. Thanks!
```
```
Figure 9.7: ActionMan
```
Basically, UserActions are a method to call external programs with variable parameters. For
example, you could have a UserAction with the following **xmms--enqueue %aList(**  **Sel
ected**  **)%** to enqueue all selected items of the active panel to the current instance of xmms.
Additionally, there is limited access to Krusader internal functions requiring parameters. For
example, **%aPanelSize(**  **80**  **)%** will set the width of the active panel to 80% of the Krusader
mainwindow. Since the parameter of placeholders can contain other placeholders, few scripts
are possible.

**Managing UserActions**

Open Konfigurator and choose **User Actions** → **Start ActionMan** , in which you can add, edit,
remove, import and export UserActions.

- **Add Action** : If you add an new action, you get an empty input mask where you can enter all
    the properties you desire. The action will be added as soon as you press **Apply**. Afterwards,
    the name is shown in the list on the left.
- To edit a UserAction: Select the UserAction on the left. Then choose it if you want to edit its
    properties. The changes will only take effect when you press **Apply**.


- **To remove a UserAction** : Select the UserAction on the left and click the button.
- **To import a UserAction** : If you import some actions, they will be automatically added to your
    list. If there are name conflicts (the names have to be unique because these are the ID for
    Plasma action system), you are asked to resolve them. For this, the list on the left will only
    show the actions where conflicts exist. You can now give them new names or remove them.
- **Export Action** : If you export a UserAction you have to give a filename in which to store it. If
    it does not exist, it will be created. If the file already contains UserActions, the action you are
    exporting will be added to that file.

All actions you have defined are now shown in the user menu and in Plasma dialogs for changing
shortcuts and managing the toolbar. In addition, all actions available for the current item will also
show up in the right click menu.

**Basic Properties**

**Identifier** , **Title** and **Command line** are always required, all the other properties are optional.

- **Identifier** : A unique name of the UserAction, used to identify it for Plasma action system.
- **Icon button** : The icon for your UserAction.
- **Category** : Categories are used for a better overview. They appear as submenu items in the
    **Useractions** menu.
- **Title** : The title displayed in the menus or dialogs.
- **Tooltip** : A tooltip for your UserAction, e.g. displayed in the toolbar on mouseover.
- **Description** : A description of what the UserAction does. This is also displayed as **What’s This**
    if you **Shift** + **F1** click on your UserAction.
- **Command** : The command which will be executed. You can add placeholder using a GUI with
    the **add** button.
- **Workdir** : The working folder for the command which will be executed.
- **Execution mode** :
    **- Normal** : Normal execution mode.
    **- Run in terminal** : Runs the command in the terminal.
    **- Run in embedded terminal emulator** : Runs the command in the embedded terminal.
    **- Collect output** : Collects the output of the executed program in a GUI window.
    **- Separate standard error** : When ‘Collect output’ is used the stdout and stderr are separately
       collected.
- **Command accepts** :
    **- Local files only (no URLs)** : Tells the placeholder it should return local addresses.
    **- URLs (remote and local)** : Tells the placeholder it should return URLs.
- **Default shortcut** : Configures a default shortcut for the UserAction.
- **Enabled** : if checked, the useraction is shown in the User Menu, otherwise the useraction will
    be hidden.

**Command-line syntax**

Basically, everything you type in the command line will get executed (if you type ‘ls -l’, ‘ls -l’ gets
executed). You have the possibility to get a character string from Krusader which represents the
current state of the panel. This is done using placeholders. A placeholder begins with a percent-
sign (’%’) and is followed by a panel indicator (’a’ for the active, ’o’ for the other, ’l’ for the left
and ’r’ for the right panel. If the placeholder does not need a panel to operate on, you have to


indicate this by an underscore (’_’)). Then comes the name of the placeholder (see the list below),
which may get some parameters enclosed in quotes. Finally, again the percent sign.

This sounds very complicated, so let’s make an example: ’%aList(Selected)%’ is replaced by a
list of all selected items in the active panel. So a command like ’xmms --enqueue %aList(All,
,,*.mp3)%’ will execute xmms with a list of all .mp3s in the current panel, separated by a
single blank.

Currently, these placeholders are implemented:

- **Path** - replaced by the panels path
    1. Parameter (optional): Automatic escape spaces. Default: yes
- **Count** - replaced by the number of <first parameter>
    1. Parameter: Which items; either ‘All’, ‘Selected’, ‘Files’ or ‘Dirs’
- **Filter** - replaced by the panel’s filter mask
- **Current** - replaced by the current item
    1. Parameter (optional): Omit the current path. Default: no
    2. Parameter (optional): Automatic escape spaces. Default: yes
- **List** - replaced by a list of all <first parameter>
    1. Parameter: Which items; either ‘All’, ‘Selected’, ‘Files’ or ‘Dirs’
    2. Parameter (optional): Separator between the items. Default: ‘ ’
    3. Parameter (optional): Omit the current path. Default: no
    4. Parameter (optional): Filtermask (for all but ‘Selected’). Default: *
    5. Parameter (optional): Automatic escape spaces. Default: yes
- **Select** - manipulates the selection in a panel
    1. Parameter: Filtermask
    2. Parameter (optional): manipulate in which way; either ‘Set’, ‘Add’ or ‘Remove’. Default:
       ‘Set’
- **Goto** - changes the panels’ path to <first parameter>
    1. Parameter: A relative or absolute path, or an URL
    2. Parameter (optional): Open the location in a new tab. Default: no
- **Ask** - asks the user for some text and is replaced by the answer
    1. Parameter: The Question
    2. Parameter (optional): A default answer
    3. Parameter (optional): A caption for the question box
- **Clipboard** - manipulates the clipboard
    1. Parameter: The text that should go to the clipboard (you may want to use ‘%aCurrent%’
       here)
    2. Parameter (optional): Append the text to the current content of the clipboard with this
       separator
- **Copy** - copies a file, useful for quick, local backups
    1. Parameter: What should be copied
    2. Parameter: Where it should be copied


- **Sync** - opens the Synchronizer with a given profile
    1. Parameter: A profile for the Synchronizer
- **NewSearch** - opens the search windows with a given profile
    1. Parameter: A profile for the search module
- **Profile** - loads a given panel profile
    1. Parameter: A panel profile
- **Each** - splits the commandline into a list. These commands are executed one after another.
    1. Parameter: A list item (all, all files, all dirs, all selected).
- **Move** - move from source to destination.
    1. Parameter: A source
    2. Parameter: A destination
- **PanelSize** - change the ratio between the two panels.
    1. Parameter (optional): A integer value, e.g., 80 makes the active panel use 80% of Kru-
       sader’s width (height in vertical mode), omitting the parameter means 50%.
- **Ask** - cancel the execution.
    1. Parameter (optional): A string for the cancel question.
- **ListFile** - is replaced by path/file name of a temporary file containing a list of items
    1. Parameter: path/filename
- **ColSort** - set the sorting on a column of a specific panel.
    1. Parameter: Column: Either ‘Name’, ‘Ext’, ‘Type’, ‘Size’, ‘Modified’, ‘Perms’, ‘rwx’,
       ‘Owner’ and ‘Group’
    2. Parameter: Sort sequence: Either ‘Toggle’, ‘Asc’, ‘Desc’
- **View** - set the view mode.
    1. Parameter: View mode: Either ‘generic’, ‘text’, ‘hex’
    2. Parameter: Window Mode: Either ‘tab’, ‘window’

A GUI-based helper for placeholder adding is provided. Spaces in Path, Current and List are
by default, automatically escaped. There is one more important thing to know: All placeholders
that interact with Krusader internal functions are called at expand time (meaning directly when
the placeholders are replaced). External programs are called at execution time (meaning after all
placeholders are replaced).

**Advanced Properties**

Here you can configure where your command should be visible (for the right click menu). In
addition, it is possible to change the command executed and confirm it separately. You can also
set a user under which the command should be executed.

- Configures if the action is valid for a Protocol, Path, MIME type or File name.
- Tweaking the command line before being executed.
- Set a different user for the execution (this has no effect in Krusader internal functions)


## Chapter 10

# Konfigurator: Krusader’s

# Configuration Center

Konfigurator is Krusaders configuration center. When running Krusader, use **Settings** →
**Configure Krusader...** , and it will start Konfigurator. There you can modify the way Krusader
works and customize it to your own needs. At any time, pressing the **Apply** button applies the
changes, pressing **Close** closes Konfigurator, and pressing **Defaults** re-applies Krusader’s ‘fac-
tory’ settings. Konfigurator is divided into pages, each containing items related to that page. For
some changes to the GUI, you have to close and restart Krusader.

```
NOTE
Since Krusader-1.80.0 the Key-Bindings and Main Toolbar-Actions Toolbar have received their own
configuration windows and so they are not a part anymore of Konfigurator, you can configure them
now via the Settings menu.
```
### 10.1 Startup

The startup page determines the way that Krusader looks (and works) when it is launched. It is
divided into two main parts:

**General**

- **Startup Profile** : Starts the selected Panel profile at startup. **<Last session>** is a special
    Panel Profile, it is saved automatically when closing Krusader.
- **Show splashscreen** : Displays a splash screen when starting Krusader.
- **Single Instance Mode** : Allows only one Krusader instance to run.
- **Fallback Icon Theme** : Allows you to configure a fallback icon theme for Krusader.
    Whenever icon is not found in system icon theme, this theme will be used as a fallback.
    If the fallback theme does not contain the icon, Breeze or Oxygen will be used if any of
    these are present.

**User Interface**

```
Determines which parts of the user interface are visible after start-up.
```

```
Figure 10.1: Startup configuration
```
- **Save last position, size and panel settings** : When launched, Krusader resizes itself to
    the size it was when last shut-down. Krusader also appears in the same location on the
    screen, having panels sorted and aligned as they were. If this option is unchecked, you
    can use the menu **Window** → **Save Position** option to manually set Krusader size and
    position at start-up.
- **Update default panel settings** : If checked, the default panel settings will be updated
    after start-up.
- **Start to system tray** : if checked, Krusader starts to tray (if minimize to tray is set), with-
    out showing the main window.
- **Save component settings on exit** : If checked, restores the user interface components to
    their condition when last shut-down.
- **Show function keys** : If checked, the FN Keys Bar is visible after start-up.
- **Show statusbar** : If checked, the Statusbar is visible after start-up. Available only if the
    **Save component settings on exit** item is unchecked.
- **Show command line** : If checked, the Command Line is visible after start-up. Available
    only if the **Save component settings on exit** item is unchecked.
- **Show embedded terminal** : If checked, the Terminal emulator is visible after start-up.
    Available only if the **Save component settings on exit** item is unchecked.

### 10.2 Panel

Here you can determine the look and feel of panel - which means finetuning the application to
your needs. The page is divided into six tabs: **General** , **View** , **Buttons** , **Selection Mode** , **Media
Menu** , and **Layout** :

    last part of the path is displayed.
- **Expanding tabs** : If checked, Krusader expands the folder tabs to fill the whole bar.
- **Close tab by double click** : If checked, Krusader allows closing the folder tabs by double-
    clicking on them.
- **Insert tabs after current** : If checked, Krusader inserts new tabs to the right of the current one
    instead of placing them into the end of the Tab bar.
- **Duplicate active tab by click** : Lets you select the active tab duplication mode ( **Disabled** (no
    clicking association), **Alt+Click** or **Ctrl+Click** ).
- **Tab Bar position** : Lets you choose Tab bar position ( **Bottom** or **Top** ).
- **Show close tab buttons** : If checked, Krusader displays close buttons on tabs.
- **Show new tab button** : If checked, Krusader displays new tab button on the Tab bar.
- **Show Tab Bar on single tab** : If checked, Krusader displays the Tab Bar even if there is only
    one tab on the panel.
- **New tab button duplicates a tab** : If checked, new tab button duplicates a tab, otherwise it
    opens a tab in home folder.

**SEARCH BAR**

- **Start by typing** : allows to select if quick search feature is used. When checked, you can open
    search bar and start searching by typing something while viewing folder contents in the active
    panel.
- **Case sensitive** : When you use the search or filter feature: If checked (the UNIX®default),
    all files beginning with capital letters appear before files beginning with lower case letters;
    otherwise, all files beginning with a specified letter (capital or otherwise) will be displayed
    together.


- **Up/Down cancels search** : Pressing **Up** or **Down** key cancels search bar.
- **Folder navigation with Right Arrow** : If checked, pressing the **Right** key enters folder if no
    search text editing intention is captured.
- **Position** : Lets you choose search and filter bar position ( **Bottom** or **Top** ).

    You can change the mode later using the search bar itself.

**BOOKMARKSEARCH**

- **Always show search bar** : If checked, make bookmark search bar always visible.
- **Search in special items** : If checked, bookmark search is also applied to special items in book-
    mark menu like **Trash** , **Popular URLs** , **Jump Back** , etc.

**STATUS/TOTALSBAR**

- **Show size in bytes too** : If checked, Krusader displays size in bytes on statusbar or totalsbar.
- **Show space information** : If checked, Krusader displays free/total disk space in the Status-
    /Totalsbar.

#### 10.2.2 View

**GENERAL**

- **View font** : Allows you to change the font used inside the file lists.
- **Tooltip delay (msec)** : Allows you to configure the delay in milliseconds between the moment
    you have stopped mouse pointer above an item in a file list and the moment when the tooltip
    will be shown.
- **Use human readable file size** : If checked, the file size appears in kB, Mb etc., and not in bytes
    (default).
- **Numeric permissions** : **Permission** column shows octal numbers ’ 0755 ’ instead of ’rwxr-xr-x’.
- **Show hidden files** : If checked, Krusader displays the ‘dot-files’ which are otherwise hidden.
- **Load the user defined folder icons** : If checked, Krusader loads the user defined folder icons.
- **Always show current item** : If checked, Krusader shows current item border decoration in
    inactive panel.
- **Sort method**
    **- Krusader (default)** : the comparison used so far. Uses comparison using locale rules (even
       context rules).
    **- Alphabetical** : strings are compared character by character (no context rules from locale ap-
       plied). Alphabet characters are compared using locale rules, special characters are compared
       by the character code.
    **- Alphabetical and numbers** : the same as above, but if the names contains numbers, the
       numbers are compared numerically instead of alphabetically.
    **- Character code** : comparison by character code (quick).
    **- Character code and numbers** : the same as above, but with numerical comparison of num-
       bers.


- **Case sensitive sorting** : If checked (the UNIX®default), all files beginning with capital letters
    appear before files beginning with non-capital letters; otherwise, all files beginning with a
    specified letter (capital or otherwise) appear together.
- **Always sort dirs by name** : Sorts folders by name, regardless of the sort column.
- **Show folders first** : If checked folders have precedence in folder lists.
- **Locale aware sorting** : Sorts files and folders according to the current locale settings.

**VIEW MODES**

- **Default view mode** : Allows you to change the default view mode. You can choose **Detailed**
    **View** or **Brief View**. On tabs of both view modes you can define the following options.
- **Default icon size** : Allows you to change the size of the icons in the file lists. The available
    sizes are 12x12, 16x16, 22x22, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128 and 256x256 pixels.
- **Use icons in the filenames** : If checked, show the icons in file names and folders.
- **Show previews by default** : If checked, show the previews of file contents.
- To configure the columns use the right click menu in the panel when viewing files. The left
    and right panel use their own columns independently. The following columns are available:
    **- Name** : Shows the filename without the part after the last dot, this latter part is displayed in
       the **Ext** column. When the **Ext** column is made hidden, the complete filename is shown in
       the **Name** column like e.g. Konqueror does.
    **- Ext** : Shows the last part of the filename (the part after the last dot) in the **Ext** column, and
       not as a complete filename in the **Name** column like e.g. Konqueror does.
    **- Type** : Shows the MIME type field.
    **- Size** : Shows the size field.
    **- Modified** : Shows the modified date and time field.
    **- Perms** : Shows the full permissions, e.g., ’rwxr-xr-x’ or as octal numbers ’ 0755 ’ instead with
       enable/disable **Numeric Permissions** in **Panel View** Tab.
    **- rwx** : Shows only the rights of the current user, e.g., ‘-rw’.
    **- Owner** : Shows the owner field.
    **- Group** : Shows the group field.

```
TIP
Uncheck the columns not in use. This allows more space for columns in use.
```
#### 10.2.3 Buttons

**Toolbar buttons have icons** : If checked, Krusader displays icons on toolbar buttons.

**Show Media Button** : If checked, Krusader displays media button.

**Show Back Button** : If checked, Krusader displays back button.

- **Home button (** ~ **)**
- **Root button (/)**
- **Toggle-button for sync-browsing** : If checked, shows the Sync-browsing button.

#### 10.2.4 Selection Mode

Here you can configure the selection modes.

**GENERAL**

- **Krusader Mode** : The way Krusader has worked from day one. Both mouse keys allow se-
    lecting files. To select more than one file, hold the **Ctrl** key and click the left mouse button.
    Right-click menu appears with a short click on the right mouse button.
- **Konqueror Mode** : pressing the left mouse button selects files -- you can click and select mul-
    tiple files. Right-click menu appears with a short click on the right mouse button.
- **Total commander Mode** : Pressing the right mouse button selects multiple files and the right-
    click menu appears with **pressing and holding** the right mouse button. The left mouse button
    does not select, but sets the current file without affecting the current selection.
- **Ergonomic Mode** : The left mouse button does not select, but sets the current file without
    affecting the current selection. The right mouse button invokes the context-menu. You can
    select with **Ctrl** key and the left button.
- **Custom Selection Mode** : Create your own selection style!

**DETAILS**

- **Double-click selects (classic)** : A single click on a file will select and focus, a double click opens
    the file or steps into the folder.
- **Obey global selection policy** : Pressing the left mouse button selects files -- Use global setting:
    **Input Devices** → **Mouse** module in the Plasma System Settings.
- Custom Selection Mode items:
    **- Based on Plasma’s selection mode**
    **- left mouse button selects**
    **- left mouse button preserves selection**
    **- Shift/Ctrl + left clicking selects**
    **- right mouse button selects**
    **- right mouse button preserves selection**
    **- Shift/Ctrl + right clicking selects**
    **- Spacebar moves down**
    **- Insert moves down**
    **- Right-clicking pops context menu immediately**
    **- A plain mouse button resets selection** - resets selection on a mouse click without modifiers
       (i.e. **Shift** or **Ctrl** ). Selection with **Shift** / **Ctrl** for the mouse button has to be enabled for this
       setting to work.


#### 10.2.5 Media Menu

Using this tab you can select the Media button menu contents:

- **Show Mount Path** : show the mount path of partition if checked.
- **Show File System Type** : show the file system type of partition if checked.
- **Hide SquashFS entries** : Snap creates many SquashFS-mounted partitions, which are almost
    useless in the Media Menu, because snap manages them. It is possible to hide SquashFS
    mounts by checking this item.
- **Hide following mountpoints** : this list allows to exclude unwanted items from Media Menu.
    Press the **+** button above the list to add some mount point you want to ignore. Should you
    decide to remove the added mount point from the list just click on it and press the **-** button.
- **Show Size:** allows selection of the size representation in media menu. Can be **Always** (default,
    always show the size of partition), **When Device has no Label** (show the size for partitions
    with no label only) or **Never** (never show the size in media menu).

#### 10.2.6 Layout

You can choose the layout and frame settings:

- **Layout:** allows to define layout. The default options are **Default** , **Compact** , and **Classic**.
- **Frame Color:** defines frame color. Can be **Defined by Layout** , **None** , or **Statusbar**.
- **Frame Shape:** defines frame color. Can be **Defined by Layout** , **None** , **Box** , or **Panel**.
- **Frame Shadow:** defines frame color. Can be **Defined by Layout** , **None** , **Raised** , or **Sunken**.

### 10.3 Colors

This page configures the colors of the List Panel and the Synchronizer. The **KDE default colors**
is the default color configuration.

**General**

- **Use the default KDE colors** : this is the default, it uses Plasma color defined in the System
    Settings.
- **Use Alternate Background color** : If checked, the **Background** color and the **Alternate**
    **background** color alternates line by line. When you do not use the Plasma default colors,
    you can configure the alternate colors in the **Colors** box.
- **Show current item even if not focused** : If checked, shows the last cursor position in
    the non active list panel. This option is only available when you do not use the Plasma
    default colors.
- **Dim the colors of the inactive panel** : If checked, the colors of the inactive panel are
    dimmed. These settings can be configured in the **Inactive** tab of the **Colors** box. This
    option is only available when you do not use the Plasma default colors.

**Colors**

```
Configure the colors the way you like, you can see the result in the Preview section. The
following items of the active and inactive panel can be configured:
```
- **Foreground**


- **Folder foreground**
- **Executable foreground**
- **Symbolic link foreground**
- **Invalid symlink foreground**
- **Background**
- **Alternate background**
- **Selected foreground**
- **Selected background**
- **Alternate selected background**
- **Current foreground**
- **Selected current foreground**
- **Current background**
- **Rename foreground**
- **Rename background**

```
The following items of the Synchronizer can be configured:
```
- **Equals foreground**
- **Equals background**
- **Differing foreground**
- **Differing background**
- **Copy to left foreground**
- **Copy to left background**
- **Copy to right foreground**
- **Copy to left background**
- **Delete foreground**
- **Delete background**

**Preview**

```
Here you see a preview of the configured colors.
```
**Color schemes**

```
With the Import Color Scheme and Export Color Scheme buttons you can load and save
a Color Scheme profile. This allows Krusader to use Total Commander©, Midnight Com-
mander, foo-commander or your own custom color profile. The Color Schemes are stored
in/usr/share/krusader, thefoo.coloris a binary file that holds the color scheme.
```
```
TIP
Midnight Commander and Total Commander©Color scheme files are provided. Please upload
your favorite Color schemes so that they become available for the Krusader community. Thanks!
```
### 10.4 General

Here you configure the basic operations. The page is divided into three tabs: **General** , **View-
er/Editor** , and **Atomic extensions**.


#### 10.4.1 General

The following options determine basic aspects of operation:

- **Warn on exit** : if checked, Krusader warns you every time when exit action is triggered.
- **Show and close to tray** : If checked, the Krusader icon will appear in the system tray. When
    you minimize Krusader, it will not appear in the taskbar. It also will not exit if you close
    the main window. Instead you can quit Krusader by selecting **File** → **Quit** menu item or the
    context menu of the tray icon.
- **Use MIME type magic** : MIME type magic is a mechanism which allows Krusader to inspect
    the files in the panels and determine their type even if the file has no identifying extension.
    For example, if you take an image file -image1.jpg- and rename it toimage1, Krusader will
    still know it is an image file and work with it accordingly. However, this mode of operation
    is slower (while refreshing the panel, or changing folders), so try Krusader with and without
    MIME type magic and decide what is best for you.
- **Temp Folder** : this option selects the base folder for Krusader’s temporary files. The actual files
    will be created in separate folders under the ’Temp folder’, so that each user running Krusader
    will have their own temporary subfolders under the chosen folder.

```
NOTE
You must choose a temporary folder to which all users running Krusader have full permissions!
```
**Delete mode** ( **Delete files/Move to trash** ): when Krusader deletes files it can eitherreallydelete
them or move them to the trash folder, thereby making them available via Plasma’s trash.

**External Terminal** : choose which terminal emulator will be used when Krusader opens a console
window (via **F9** , or **Tools** → **Start Terminal** menu option).

**Embedded Terminal sends Chdir on panel change** : if unchecked, there will be no **cd** command
sent to the Terminal Emulator if the panel folder changes.

**Active panel follows Embedded Terminal working directory** : if unchecked, active panel stays
unchanged while the user navigates in the embedded terminal (using cd, popd, etc).

**Toggle Fullscreen Embedded Terminal** : if checked, Krusader shows fullscreen terminal in Mid-
night Commander style (Terminal is shown instead of Krusader window).

#### 10.4.2 Viewer/Editor

Here you can change the viewer and editor settings:

- **Internal editor and viewer opens each file in separate window** : check this item if you want
    each file to be opened in a separate window. If unchecked, each file will be opened in a tab
    in the same Viewer/Editor window. Every tab in such a window can be closed, among other
    common methods, by clicking on the tab with the middle mouse button.
- **Hide the tab bar when only one tab is opened** : check this item if you want the Viewer/Editor
    tab bar to be hidden if only one tab is open.
- **Default viewer mode** :
    **- Generic mode** : use the systems default viewer.
    **- Text mode** : view the file in text-only mode.
    **- Hex mode** : view the file in hex-only mode.


**- Lister mode** : Fast text/hexadecimal viewer for huge filesizes. Krusader lister never loads
    the whole file into memory, just a little part of it, and uses caching for faster scrolling. Remote
    files are downloaded, but during the download, viewing the downloaded part is possible.
    If a file constantly changes, then it can also be viewed, lister will always see its current state.
**- Use lister if the text file is bigger than: 10 MB (default value)** : checks whether a text file is
    bigger than 10 MB (configurable), and if yes, then Krusader Lister is used instead of Plasma’s
    default viewer.
**- Use Okteta as Hex viewer** : if checked (default option), use Plasma hex editor Okteta to view
    raw data. To use this option you should install Okteta package first.
- **Editor** : choose what editor will be used when editing a file (via **F4** ). Default the internal viewer
is used, this is the Plasma’s default viewer.

#### 10.4.3 Atomic extensions

**Atomic extensions** : predefined atomic extensions like.tar.gzare shown as one part in the **Ext**
Column of the List Panel.

### 10.5 Advanced

This page handles more advanced issues, so you should double-check your actions here: modi-
fying settings here makes Kru-
sader a more
powerful and
dangerous
tool.

The page is divided into three parts:

**General**

- **Automount filesystems** : this makes Krusader try to mount a file system before entering
    it. For example, if you click on/mnt/cdrom(and/mnt/cdromappears in/etc/fstabas a
    mount point), Krusader will check if it is mounted. If not, it will try and mount it for you
    and then enter, so that you would see the contents of your CD-ROM. Note, however, that
    Krusader will NOT unmount when exiting/mnt/cdrom.
- **MountMan will not (un)mount the following mount points** : If you have file systems
    that you do not want to accidentally unmount (or mount) then enter a list of mount points
    separated by commas (e.g./, /boot, /tmp) and MountMan will not try to (un)mount
    them.

**Confirmations**

```
By checking the options in this section, Krusader will ask for confirmation before doing a
specific action; otherwise, the following actions will be done without warning:
```
- Deleting non-empty folders
- Deleting files
- Copying files
- Moving files

**Fine-Tuning**

- **Icon cache size (KB)** : Krusader uses an icon cache, so it will not have to reload icons that
    have been used before. Of course, as the cache grows bigger, it can store more icons and
    further speed operations, but the memory footprint of Krusader will become bigger.
- **Arguments of updatedb** : sets additional arguments for **updatedb** , please read the man-
    pages for more information.


### 10.6 Archives

This page configures some aspects of archive handling in Krusader.

**krarc ioslave**

```
Enable Write Support : this option allows you to enable writing files into an archive.
```
```
WARNING
The down side is that if a power failure occurs during the process, the files that were moved
might already be deleted, but not yet packed into the archive. Moving archives into themselves
will delete them.
```
**Archive handling**

```
Browse Archives As Folders : if checked, Krusader will handle the archives transparently
and let you open them as folders; otherwise, Krusader will attempt to invoke an application
which opens archives of that type.
```
**Fine-Tuning**

- **Test archive after packing** : this option automatically runs a test on a newly packed
    archive. It is safer, but takes longer.
- **Test archives before unpacking** : this option automatically runs a test before unpacking.
    Some corrupted archives might cause a crash; therefore, it is better to test archives before
    unpacking.

### 10.7 Dependencies page

This page configures the full path of the external applications. It is even possible to configure the
full path of Krusader!

**General tab**

Here you can configure the full path of the following external applications:

```
application configurable full path
kdesu /usr/bin/kdesu
kget /usr/bin/kget
mailer /usr/bin/kmail
diff utility /usr/bin/kompare
krename /usr/bin/krename
krusader /usr/bin/krusader
locate /usr/bin/locate
mount /bin/mount
umount /bin/umount
updatedb /usr/bin/updatedb
```
```
TIP
By default Kompare is used as external diff utility but you can also use your favorite diff utility e.g. xxdiff
or KDiff3, just fill in the full path and enjoy.
```

**Packers tab**

In the **Packers** tab you will see a list of archive formats. Some are filled and some are empty. The
ones that are available (filled) are supported by Krusader. For them, Krusader will handle the
archives transparently and let you open them as folders (provided you have checked the **Browse
Archives As Folders** item in the Archives section); otherwise, Krusader will attempt to invoke
an application which opens archives of that type. If a certain archive item is empty, it means that
Krusader could not find the appropriate executables in the configured path. The next archives
are supported: ace, arj, bzip2, deb, gzip, iso, lha, lzma, rar, rpm, tar, xz, zip and 7z.

```
packer configurable full path
7z usr/bin/7z
arj usr/bin/arj
bzip2 usr/bin/bzip2
cpio /bin/cpio
dpkg /bin/dpkg
gzip /usr/bin/gzip
lha /usr/bin/lha
lzma /usr/bin/lzma
rar /usr/bin/rar
tar /bin/tar
unace /usr/bin/unace
unarj /usr/bin/unarj
unrar /usr/bin/unrar
unzip /usr/bin/unzip
zip /usr/bin/zip
xz /usr/bin/xz
```
```
NOTE
Krusader may not be compatible with ACE despite our best efforts. Unace uses closed source and
contains additional lines that make Unace get into infinite loop if the stdin is redirected to somewhere
else. It works in the same manner as ’su’, where you cannot enter the password only from the stdin.
Krusader >= 1-51 emulates the command line environment to enable co-operation with Unace, but we
have noticed that Unace always changes its output format from release to release, making co-operation
almost impossible.
```
**Checksum Utilities tab**

Here you can configure the full path of the following external Checksum Utilities:

```
Checksum Utilities configurable full path supported checksums
md5sum /usr/bin/md5sum md5
sha1sum /usr/bin/sha1sum sha1
md5deep /usr/bin/md5deep md5
sha1deep /usr/bin/sha1deep sha1
sha224sum /usr/bin/sha224sum sha224
sha256sum /usr/bin/sha256sum sha256
sha256deep /usr/bin/sha256deep sha256
sha384sum /usr/bin/sha384sum sha384
sha512sum /usr/bin/sha512sum sha512
tigerdeep /usr/bin/tigerdeep tiger
whirlpooldeep /usr/bin/whirlpooldeep whirlpool
cfv /usr/bin/cfv 107 md5, sha1, sfv, crc
```

### 10.8 UserActions

Here you can configure the terminal for UserActions and the font for the output-collection. The
default terminal is **konsole --noclose -e**. To set up, configure and manage your UserActions use
ActionMan (UserActions URL).

### 10.9 Protocols

This page links the MIMEs to protocols. e.g. protocol ‘tar’ is linked to MIME ‘application/x-tar’.

In the **Links** you will see e.g.

- Iso
    **-** application/x-iso
- krarc
    **-** application/x-ace
    **-** application/x-arj
    **-** application/x-bzip2
    **-** application/x-cpio
    **-** application/x-deb
    **-** application/x-debian-package
    **-** application/x-gzip
    **-** application/x-jar
    **-** application/x-lha
    **-** application/x-rar
    **-** application/x-rpm
    **-** application/x-zip
- tar
    **-** application/x-tar
    **-** application/x-tarz
    **-** application/x-tbz
    **-** application/x-tgz


## Chapter 11

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

If you have problems with Krusader please check the installation procedure, as your problem
may be caused by a bad installation.

The FAQ is divided into three sections:

- Installation FAQ (this page)
- Usage FAQ (issues with running/using Krusader)
- General FAQ (bug reports, forum, mailing list, ...)

If you feel that a FAQ is missing or if something is not clear to you, please let us know.

### 11.1 Installation FAQ

1. Does Krusader need Plasma to run?
    No, Krusader does not need the Plasma window managerto run on your computer but Kru-
    sader’s natural environment is Plasma, because it relies on services provided by the KDE
    Frameworks 5 base libraries. Only some shared libraries are needed e.g. KDE Frameworks
    libraries, Qt™ libraries, etc. This means that Krusader runs on GNOME, AfterStep, XFce
    and other window managers provided the appropriate libraries are installed on your com-
    puter. All this is not a problem since the apt-get world can resolve these dependencies
    instantly.
    You do not need to switch to the Plasma window manager to use Krusader; you can still
    use GNOME, AfterStep, XFce or another window manager. However, the configuration of
    the Krusader fonts and some behavior is done by running **systemsettings**.
    A lot depends on what you want to do with Krusader. You should know that Krusader
    uses the KDE Frameworks KIO Slaves to access remote file systems, and support for only
    a limited number of file system types are shipped with KDE Frameworks libraries, most of
    the KIO Slave are bundled with KDE Frameworks 5 (including fish, sftp and tar).
    To summarize, if you want a working Krusader - install KDE Frameworks 5. If you want a
    functional Krusader then you need KDE Frameworks 5 and some additional Plasma pack-
    ages. For maximum functionality, Krusader needs some KDE Applications (Ark, KDiff3,
    KRename), but the Plasma window manager is optional.
2. I cannot find a package for Krusader, what to do?
    Check if your distribution provides Krusader, if it does not then contact your distribution
    creator and ask them to include Krusader!


```
Did you take a look at the installation procedure page? If you have and found nothing, you
can always compile Krusader from source. Feel free to post a help request if you encounter
problems.
```
3. I am having trouble compiling and installing Krusader, how do I send a help request?
    Please read our detailed installation procedure and the FAQ. If you cannot find a solution
    to your problem then feel free to post a **help request** at our Krusader forum or use the
    Krusader-users mailing list. But before posting a help request, please try the following:

```
(a) Use the search function on the KDE Forum, your problem might be solved or dis-
cussed already.
(b) If you cannot find a solution, please make a note of the following issues:
```
- the Krusader version used
- the Linux®distribution + version used
- a good description of the problem
Without this information, it is very difficult for us to help you.

```
NOTE
If you give us the error messages (e.g. make error messages) please start with the FIRST
error message, all the error messages which follow the first error message are conse-
quences and not the cause of your problem.
```
```
(c) Send out your help request.
```
```
Thank you for your co-operation!
```
4. Why does Krusader-git show an old version number in the about box?
    Because we only change the version number just before we do a new release. Krusader-git
    will show an older version number, so ignore the version number and check the download
    date. We simply have not yet decided what the next version number will be.

### 11.2 Usage FAQ

1. Why does Krusader freeze or hang on a dead mountpoint?
    When Krusader is e.g. browsing an NFS share and the NFS server goes down, Krusader
    will freeze. This Krusader (and all other open internal viewers/editors) freeze is fatal, and
    can only be corrected with the **kill -9**. We have no solution for this. This is an issue not
    confined to file managers, or even the Linux®OS! The problem is that you ‘hang’ on the
    first access to the dead share - so there is no way around it, no check to avoid it, even **ls** will
    freeze. Just trying to read something - anything - is enough to get you stuck. The one and
    only way around this architectural problem is using a multi-threaded design - this way if
    we get stuck, we do not hang the entire application event loop, but we do not think that the
    time is right for adding threads, we are not sure that *all* the KDE Frameworks systems out
    there are using Qt™-mt (the multi threaded version of the Qt™ library), and the Krusader
    Krew may not be the right people to address this major issue in any case; so currently this
    is just a bug we have to learn to live with.
2. When I try to resize Krusader to make it smaller, I discover that I cannot resize it below a certain
    size. Why?
    See the **F1, F2** (etc.) buttons? They are not allowing Krusader to downsize as they have a
    minimum size. Just disable them **Settings** → **Show FN Keys Bar** and you will be able to
    resize Krusader to your liking. Since version 1.51 we have improved this greatly: when
    downsizing the buttons will look like ’F5 ..py’. When the button faces are too small to read
    a tooltip will give the complete text. The minimum width is 45 pixels for each button.


3. Samba ISO 8859-x codepage / What to do if Krusader does not read shared folders containing special
    international characters?
    Krusader does not handle (yet) Samba ISO 8859-x codepages, if you use a codepage dif-
    ferent than 8859-1 you will have to do a manual configuration. Create or modify the file:
    ~/.smb/smb.conf

```
[global]
workgroup = MyWorkGroup (ex. WORKGROUP)
client code page = MyCodePage (ex. 852)
character set = MyCharSet (ex. ISO8859 -2)
```
```
You can try to configure smb.conf with appropriate System Settings module.
```
4. What to do if an external tool does not seem to work?

```
Krusader uses several programs as external tools, and sometimes they appear not to work.
Open a terminal and check if tool foo is installed.
```
```
$ foo
```
```
Check if tool foo is properly configured in the Konfigurator Dependencies page. For
Archiving tools: autodetect the archives again with the Auto Configure button in the Kon-
figurator archive page. Check the Konfigurator Protocol page If it does not work, backup
yourXDG_CONFIG_HOME /krusaderrc(default is$HOME /.config/krusaderc) configuration
file and remove it from this location. Restart Krusader, Krusader will now start the first
start configuration wizard, follow these guidelines.
```
5. How to executing jar files (and not enter the jar archive)?

```
Go to the Konfigurator Protocol page and remove application/x-jar from the krarc node,
Krusader should no longer enter the archive. Global file associations are handled by Plasma
and not by Krusader. To associate the jar extension:
```
- Open Plasma System Settings: systemsettings
- **Applications** → **File Associations**
- Enterjaras filename pattern
- Addjavaas application
6. Why do I have trouble with my FTP connection?

```
This problem often occurs when you are behind a firewall or proxy. Open System Settings
→ Network → Settings → Connection Preferences , Enable Passive Mode (PASV) has to
be turned on or off, depending on its current setting. Now try your FTP session again to see
if it works. Also, make sure you have no other FTP sessions open (using web browsers, etc.),
they can cause complications. More information can be found in Active FTP vs. Passive
FTP, a Definitive Explanation.
```
7. I get FTP protocol not supported by Krusader error when trying to open a remote FTP folder, what
    to do?
    The reason for this error is that ’FTP via HTTP proxy’ feature is not yet supported by Kru-
    sader. This error may be caused by a misconfiguration of the proxy settings in System
    Settings. Modify the proxy settings to not use HTTP proxy and FTP will work.
8. How do not add.partsuffix when copying files via FTP?

```
When uploading files a.partsuffix is added to the filename, once the upload is complete
the filename is renamed automagically to remove the.partsuffix. This works great but
sometimes some FTP servers do not allow a rename operation. You can solve this by
unchecking the checkbox Mark partially uploaded files in Plasma System Settings. The
check box is located at Network → Settings → Connection Preferences.
```
9. How can I close a remote connection (e.g. a FTP connection)?

```
It is explained in the remote connections chapter.
```

10. I am experiencing problems with the media:/ protocol, why?
    The media:/ protocol was removed since KDE 4. Please use mtp:/ protocol instead.
11. How can I disable the default sounds, e.g. when I do a delete action?
    Those are the default Plasma System sounds, and not related to Krusader. If you want to
    disable them globally open your Plasma System Settings ( systemsettings): **Personaliza-**
    **tion** → **Notifications** → **Manage Notifications** , **Event Source:**  **Plasma Workspace**  and
    uncheck sound items you do not like.
12. Where the remote connection manager?
    Use our Bookmark Manager. Use a remote URL and bookmark it.
13. Why does not MIME type magic sometimes work inside archives?
    When you enter an archive and press **F3** to view a file that has no known extension, e.g.
    README, INSTALLetc. And if the viewer opens in hex-mode instead of the usual mode, than
    you need to configure: **KDE System Settings** → **File Associations** → **Application** → **octet-**
    **stream** , **binary viewer** needs to be removed.
14. Where is Konfigurator, do i need to install the Plasma to use it?
    Konfigurator is Krusaders configuration module, if you have installed Krusader then you
    have also Konfigurator. For some reason some people think it is an other Plasma applica-
    tion, but it is not, so you do not need to install the full fledged Plasma to use Konfigurator.
    When running Krusader, use **Settings** → **Configure Krusader...** , and it will start Konfigura-
    tor. Please read the manual, Krusader has many many configuration options, a lot of things
    can be customized to your needs with Konfigurator.
15. How can I set the look & feel of 2 different users to be the same?
    Presuming that the current setup is the good configuration, you can copy the configuration
    to the other user.

```
# cp ~/.config/krusaderrc /home/foo_user/.config
```
```
And when the other user is Root use:
```
```
# cp ~/.config/krusaderrc /root/.config
```
16. How to customize the embedded terminal of Krusader?
    In order to change properties of the embedded terminal emulator of Krusader: you can
    right-click on it and choose an option, and if you don’t find there what you are looking for,
    you can use the **Settings** menu of Konsole (because Krusader uses a Konsole KPart for its
    embedded terminal). In that menu, other items are seen (like **Manage Profiles...** ).

### 11.3 General FAQ

1. How can I report a wish, a suggestion, or a comment?
    An open source project’s greatest strength is derived from getting user feedback. That is
    why we love to hear what you have to say. Your ‘gripes’ are our instructions. After about
    6 months, programmers can no longer see their own mistakes. It is natural. We want the
    ideas, qritiques, and feedback because we all want to make Krusader the best and most
    useful file manager available anywhere.
    The most convenient way to contact us is to use the krusader-users mailing list. For infor-
    mation on what remains to be done look at the Krusader-devel mailing list. We review and
    discuss every submission.


2. How can I send a patch?

```
It is not easy to write patch guidelines, but here are some.
```
```
(a) Patches, new code or new features are always welcome!
(b) Focus only on one problem at a time, so the developers can easily understand you,
and commit your patch it works.
(c) Preferably, you can start a discussion with the developers on the krusader-devel mail-
ing lists or on the Krusader GitLab page. Unfortunately, we cannot apply a patch if
the patch is in conflict with the ‘general design’ of the Krusader code (read for more
instructions in this FAQ). Please send only one change request per mail, so that the
discussion is easier to follow. The modifications should be committed step by step,
checking each line.
(d) Submit your patch files on the GitLab, so that all patch proposals stay organised and
do not get lost, tar.gz archives or diffs are usually ok. Do not copy changes into a mail.
Most mailers will change the white spaces, so that the diff will not apply or the code
snipped does not diff. In the past, patch mails went lost or disorganized in many many
mails, so please use the GitLab, thanks!
(e) Use portable solutions, Krusader should run on:
```
- All POSIX (Linux®/BSD/UNIX®-like OSes), Solaris™.
- All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD©/NetBSD®/OpenBSD®/Mac®OS).
- KDE 3.3- KDE 3.5 and even on GNOME with kdelibs (for Krusader-2.x).
- GCC 2.95 - GCC 5.4
Architecture changes are made by the team only.
(f) A final note: always keep in mind a patch might be rejected. Either it has side effects,
which we could not fix or it contradicts with the idea behind the patched module. In
this sense, a software project differs from, let’s say a wiki: a software project has to
have someone to make all the final decisions. Otherwise the software will not work.
Furthermore: keep in mind that the examination of patches might take time, as we all
have private lives.
3. How can I report a bug?

```
Bugs?!?!? Well, ok.... We have an online Bug Tracking System.
Using the online bug-tracker helps us have a clear and orderly way to know how many
bugs are open, bug priority and follow-ups. It saves us from browsing through the entire
Krusader forum, searching for yesterdays bug. Please use this system.
Before reporting a bug, please read the following:
```
```
(a) Check if the bug is already posted in the online bug list of the Bug Tracking System.
(b) If you cannot find this bug mentioned, please submit it into the bug tracker by click-
ing the Submit New button in the bug-tracker window. Please submit the following
issues: the Krusader version used, the Linux®distribution + version used, processor
type, and as good a description of the problem as you can manage.
```
```
Thank you for your co-operation!
```
```
NOTE
If possible, try to do the same operation with Konqueror or another KDE application. If you en-
counter the same problem then it is possibly a KIO Slaves or KDE Frameworks 5 bug, and not a
Krusader bug. Krusader uses the KDE Frameworks libraries and the KIO Slave for many oper-
ations. In some cases you can encounter problems if your distribution is incorrectly configured,
please test it first as explained above.
```

4. How can i send good debug or crash reports?

```
Usually binary packages that are been used by your distribution do not contain debug
information. Since we usually only develop and fix Krusader-git, compile Krusader-git in
debugmode and install it, than check if the bug still exist.
```
```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull
```
```
Install valgrind, a suite of tools for debugging and profiling Linux®programs. Run Val-
grind/Krusader
```
```
$ valgrind --tool=memcheck {foo_path}/krusader
```
```
The valgrind tool will write to stdout, what really happens. If you could send these infor-
mation before the crash, it is almost sure, that we may fix or tell you what to do.
```
5. What to do if the KDEcrashhandler sends no useful backtrace information?

```
Usually binary packages that are been used by your distribution do not contain debug
information. Since we usually only develop and fix Krusader-git, compile Krusader-git in
debugmode and install it, than check if the bug still exist.
```
```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull
```
```
If the KDEKrashhandler still does not provide useful backtrace information, than some-
times a coredump will give better information. Run Krusader, with disabled crashhandler.
```
```
$ krusader --nocrashhandler
```
```
On a crash you will get a.corefile, usually in your home folder. Run gdb, the GNU Project
Debugger
```
```
$ gdb -c corefile krusader
```
```
Now type bt to get the backtrace and type q to quit gdb. Often the best debug results will
be given when using the valgrind tool.
```
6. Does Krusader have a mailing list?

```
Yes, currently we have several mailing lists. No spam, no bother, just Krusader. Feel free to
subscribe and unsubscribe.
Tip. our mailing lists can be browsed online or read with a newsreader, so that you do not
even need to subscribe to follow the action on the mailing lists.
```
- Krusader-devel is the developer mailing list (read-only). If you want to follow the devel-
    opment of Krusader on the cutting edge, this is the list to follow.
- Krusader-users is the Krusader users mailing list. Here you can ask for help and talk
    with the Krusader users and developers.
- Krusader-news is a very low volume list, used for announcements of new versions or
    critical bugfixes.
7. Does Krusader provide news feeds?

```
Yes, we do. Several news feeds in various formats are available. krusader-devel feed,
krusader-users feed and krusader-news feed.
```
8. How does the Krusader forum work?

```
In the spirit of freedom of speech, everything that is Krusader related can be discussed in
our forum. It does not matter if you are a newcomer or an advanced user, everyone is
welcome. An open source project’s greatest strength is derived from getting user feedback.
That is why we love to hear what you have to say. With your feedback we can make Kru-
sader better and better; otherwise, we are not aware of issues and ideas you may have. But
please remember the following, so that we can maintain some order in the chaos.
```

```
If the Documentation, FAQ and Krusader-devel (please use the search function ) cannot
help you, do not hesitate to post on our forum. The Krusader Krew or the Krusader com-
munity is always available to help you.
Please use the search function of the KDE Forum, your issue may have been previously
discussed (this allows us to minimize the double/triple/... postings). If your issue has
already been discussed in the past there is a great chance that you will have an instant
solution to your problem. If the issue is currently being discussed, you can join in the
discussion. Some questions are asked over and over again, that is why we have created this
FAQ. This allows us to spend more time developing Krusader.
Thank you for your co-operation!
```
9. How can I translate Krusader into my native language?
    If you are interested in translating the Krusader GUI or documentation, please contact the
    KDE translation team of your language.
10. How can I support Krusader?

```
You can support Krusader in many different ways. Please send us feedback, bug reports,
patches, donations, translations, ...
```
11. Why is Konqueror in ‘Midnight Commander style’ not an OFM?

```
The two panels and a commandline are available, all the other stuff like OFM features and
the OFM interaction with the user is missing from this profile.
```
12. Why should I use an OFM?

```
An Orthodox File Manager (OFM) is much faster than a one panel filemanager and faster
than the command line. If you would like to know how Krusader feels, there is only one
way to discover: install it on your computer and use it for a while. If you prefer to waste
time and lose productivity, continue to use one panel filemanagers which are based on
Windows®Explorer. Matej Urbanˇciˇc has written a blog on why OFM is better than a one
panel filemanager.

## Appendix B

# useractions.xml

This appendix gives several examples ofuseractions.xmlfiles. With this you can begin to dis-
cover the power of the UserActions and start learning how to use them. Once you understand
how to write UserActions you will find that Krusader is an even more powerful, customizable
tool.

Please consider uploading your UserActions at store.kde.org as we are collecting them. If your
UserAction is selected by us it will be shipped with Krusader at the next release.

## Appendix C

# Glossary

This chapter is intended to explain the various words which have been used throughout the
Krusader documentation. If you believe some acronyms or terms are missing, please do not
hesitate to contact the Krusader documentation team.

Thanks to wikipedia.org the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.

**ACL**

```
Access Control List; a concept in computer security used to enforce privilege separation.
It is a means of determining the appropriate access rights to a given object depending on
certain aspects of the process that is making the request.
```
**BSD**

```
Berkeley Software Distribution; refers to any of several free UNIX®-compatible operating
systems, derived from BSD™ UNIX®.
```
**CVS**

```
Concurrent Versions System; an important component of Source Configuration Manage-
ment (SCM). By using it, developers can record the history of source files and documents.
```
**DEB**

```
This is a binary file format that is used by Debian and Debian-based distributions. It is a
suffix of a installation file specifically built for these distributions; e.g.krusader_1.70.1-1_
amd64.deb. Simply described it is a special archive containing all the program files and their
proposed location on the system.
```
**D-Bus**

```
D-Bus is an inter-service messaging system. Developed by Red Hat®, it was heavily influ-
enced by KDE 3 DCOP, which it supersedes. Krusader can use D-Bus to communicate with
other applications. On the other hand, you can use D-Bus to control Krusader from other
applications. Just use qdbusviewer to examine the possibilities.
```
**DCOP**

```
Desktop Communication Protocol; the interprocess communication protocol used by KDE
3 desktop environment. It enables various KDE 3 applications to communicate with each
other. Replaced with D-Bus in KDE 4.
```
**FAQ**

```
Frequently Asked Questions; a document where questions that arise many times are an-
swered. If you have a question to the developers of Krusader, you should always have a
look at the FAQ first.
```

**FTP**

```
File Transfer Protocol; it is an Internet protocol that allows you to retrieve files from so-
called FTP servers.
```
**Git**

```
Git; a distributed version control system that replaces Subversion. It is used by many soft-
ware projects including KDE and Krusader.
```
**GPL**

```
GNU General Public License; a software license created by the Free Software Foundation
defining the terms for releasing free software.
```
**GUI**

```
Graphical User Interface.
```
**ISO**

```
An ISO image (.iso) is an informal term for a disk image of an ISO 9660 file system. More
loosely, it refers to any optical disk image, even a UDF image.
```
**KDE**

```
K Desktop Environment; a project to develop a free graphical desktop environment for
UNIX®compatible systems.
```
**Key Binding**

```
All features of Krusader are available through the menubar, but you can also bind (link) a
certain key combination to that function. You will find, however, that using the keyboard
is remarkably faster than using the menubar or GUI. Keyboard usage is an important tool
for Orthodox File Managers. Krusader comes with several predefined Key Bindings.
```
**KPart**

```
KPart; KParts is the name of the component framework for the KDE desktop environment.
KParts are analogous to Bonobo components in GNOME, both of which are based on the
same concepts as Microsoft®’s Object Linking and Embedding. e.g. if you use Krusader’s
viewer to view a PDF file, Okular will be launched inside Krusader’s viewer.
```
**KIO or kioslave**

```
KDE Input/Output; also known as KIO Slaves is part of the KDE architecture. It provides
access to files, web sites and other resources through a single consistent API.
```
**mount**

```
Mounting; in computer science, is the process of making a file system ready for use by
the operating system, typically by reading certain index data structures from storage into
memory ahead of time. The term recalls a period in the history of computing when an
operator had to mount a magnetic tape or hard disk on a spindle before using it.
```
**OFM**

```
Orthodox File Manager; also known as ‘Commanders’. Members of this family of file man-
agers use simple yet very powerful interface that is a direct derivative of the Norton Com-
mander (NC) interface.
```
**RPM**

```
This is the binary file format for distributions based on the RPM Package Manager, a widely
used packaging tool for the Linux®operating system. If you still have to get Krusader and
your system supports RPM packages, you should get Krusader packages ending in.rpm.
```
**SSH , Secure Shell**

```
SSH; is a set of standards and an associated network protocol that allows establishing a
secure channel between a local and a remote computer.
```

**SVN , Subversion**

```
Subversion; a version control system that is a compelling replacement for CVS. It is used
by many software projects including KDE.
```
**Terminal emulator**

```
Terminal emulator; simply a windowed shell; this is known as command line window in
some other environments. If you want to use the shell and type the commands, you should
know at least a few of the system-level commands for your operating system.
```
**POSIX**

```
Portable Operating System Interface for uniX; a collective name of a family of related stan-
dards specified by the IEEE to define the application programming interface (API) for soft-
ware compatible with variants of the UNIX®operating system.
```
**URL**

```
Universal Resource Locator; a universal resource locator is the technical term for
what is commonly referred to as a websites address. Examples of URLs include
https://krusader.org and Remote Connections.
```
**VFS**

```
Virtual file systems (VFS) is a basic OFM feature, this an abstracted layer over all kinds
of archived information (ZIP files, FTP servers, TAR archives, NFS filesystems, SAMBA
shares, ISO CD/DVD images, RPM catalogs, etc.), which allows the user to access all the
information in these divergent types of file systems transparently - just like entering an
ordinary sub-folder! Krusader supports several Virtual file systems (VFS).
```
**XML**

```
Extensible Markup Language; a very flexible text format derived from SGML (ISO 8879).
Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also
playing an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web
and elsewhere.
```
**Zeroconf**

```
Zeroconf; or Zero Configuration Networking is a set of techniques that automatically create
a usable IP network without configuration or special servers. This allows inexpert users to
connect computers, networked printers, and other items together and expect them to work
automatically.
```
