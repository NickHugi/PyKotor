"""TSLPatcher diff module - tools for analyzing and generating patch data.

This module provides:
- analyzers: Convert raw diffs into TSLPatcher modification structures
- cache: Diff result caching system
- engine: Core comparison operations for diff detection
- enhanced_engine: Enhanced diff engine with formatting support
- formatters: Output formatters for different diff formats
- generator: Generate complete tslpatchdata folder structures
- merge3_utils: 3-way diff and merge utilities
- objects: Structured diff result objects
- resolution: Resource resolution order handling for installation comparisons
- structured: Detailed diff results for INI generation
